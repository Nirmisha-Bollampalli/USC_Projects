Todd Hunter We have listed both WILLIAM S HUNTER and SIDNEY HUNTER Then in the Hunter Family Tree given to the HHS at a later date we find also WILLIAM CARR HUNTER with a wife NORA The census shows WILLIAM S HUNTER with wife MARY G who is Mary Geraldine DeLong and she has been given to SIDNEY HUNTER by the old genealogy Also that same genealogy gives two children to Sidney and Mary ZELLA and BERYL So do we have two Williams Or is William S William Sidney or Sidney William WILLIAM CARR HUNTER seems to have different children CLARA and GUY However in the older papers we have we find that Clara and Guy were the children of Joseph Is William Carr Hunter a son of Joseph also Can anyone out there give us the straight of this family At the present I am assuming that William S Hunter is Sidney and that William Carr Hunter is another brother as they have different families _____________________________________________________________________ Additions to the generations are The latest Hunter Family Tree information we have gives this interesting tale of the name HUNTER It says that William s real name was Toddhunter and thinking it was too long he had it changed legally to Todd Hunter And that his brother was Joseph Hunter JOSEPH HUNTER Married MELINDA called Harriet Melinda on cem records And they had children MOLLIE called Big Mollie Mary Ann ORPHA Ophulia ED WILLIE Mollie married a MR BRIGHT and later a MR WILSON Child ZULA or ZULINE BRIGHT Zuline married a Mr Armstrong who had the Armstrong Mfg Co in Chicago and the manufactured badges suits uniforms etc Ed and Willie lived in the Decatur area ORPHA married a DOUGLAS and they moved to California __________________________________________________________________ ZELLA IZORA HUNTER Married ELMER LEWIS DUNTEN Children
