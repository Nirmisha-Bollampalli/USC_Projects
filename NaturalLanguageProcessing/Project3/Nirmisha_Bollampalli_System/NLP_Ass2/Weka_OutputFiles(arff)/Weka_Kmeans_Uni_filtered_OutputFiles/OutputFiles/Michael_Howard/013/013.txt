allow a younger leader to take over Mr Howard said he would stay as leader until the party had the opportunity to consider whether it wanted to change the rules for electing a successor With few seats undeclared Labour are on down the Tories on up and the Lib Dems on up Mr Howard said the party s results and c aign meant that it could now hold its head up high Labour s majority is predicted to drop from to with the party gaining of votes the lowest share of any government The Tories took seats from both Labour and the Lib Dems including Enfield Southgate from Schools Minister Stephen Twigg No backstabbing Mr Howard said after his party s recent progress there must never be a return to the bickering and backstabbing of the past Speaking at a rally in newly gained Putney Mr Howard said his age meant he could not lead the party into the next general election LATEST RESULTS Enter a full postcode seats needed to win LAB CON LD Text of Mr Howard s speech I m years old At the time of the next election in four or five years time I ll be or and I believe that s simply too old to lead a party into government So as I can t fight the next election as leader of our party I believe its better for me to stand aside sooner rather than later so that the party can choose someone who can I want to avoid the uncertainty of prolonged debate about the leadership of the party I want the next Conservative leader to have much more time than I had to prepare our party for government If we ve achieved this much in just months imagine what we can achieve in the next four or five years I ve said that if people don t deliver then they go and for me delivering meant winning the election Michael Howard Possible future leaders Howard s parting favour Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin was quick to rule himself out of the running saying he had no intention at all of standing There were changes to the process for electing a Tory leader under the stewardship of William Hague and there is already speculation that the role of the party s rank and file could be reduced Shadow minister for deregulation John Redwood refused to say whether he would be standing Mr Redwood a former challenger said it was important any reforms avoiding losing all contact with the membership Ex Conservative Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine urged his party not to rush to a decision about the leadership It will take time it will be a little messy but it will be a great deal better than another quick decision that goes wrong said Lord Heseltine Hard fight In his speech in Putney Mr Howard said he had tried his hardest to win the election I ve said many times since I became leader and during this election c aign that accountability matters I ve said that if people don t deliver then they go And for me delivering meant winning the election Tim Collins was the only shadow cabinet minister to be ousted He said the party needed to debate how it would elect his successor saying there was dissatisfaction with the rules for choosing a new leader I intend to stay as leader until the party has had the opportunity to consider whether it wishes those rules to be changed and if so how they should be changed he said When that process is complete I shall resign as leader He concluded We need to remain united never to return to the bickering and backstabbing of the past and we need to remain positive and outward looking Nasty However Labour adviser Alastair C bell said the Tories remained flat on their backs And Cabinet minister Peter Hain accused Mr Howard of leading the most ruthlessly nasty c aign that any opposition leader has fought But he has made them into a more professional fighting machine and therefore a harder opponent for the Labour Party said Mr Hain HAVE YOUR
