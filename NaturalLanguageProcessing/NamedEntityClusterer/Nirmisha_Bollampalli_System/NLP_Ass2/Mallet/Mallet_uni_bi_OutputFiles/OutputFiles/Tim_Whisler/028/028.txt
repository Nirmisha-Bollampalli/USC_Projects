Fred my boy C mon they re a rock band not prophets I don t recall using the actual terminology vegetarians suck On the contrary vegetarians CAN T suck no upper body strength Yes it IS their choice to put vegetarian propaganda on their albums It s also their choice to have a guestbook To use your words If you don t like it don t look at it Are you a vegetarian Frederick Do you take supplements I

impor tant part of their psychological development We re built like a meat eater and were never meant to eat such an innordinate amount of vegetable matter I apparently like yourself believe in

they are always sitting ready in my cd player and when I do something that I want to listen to music I play random and jam out I can do anything with BOSTON blaring in my ear It is so hard to say what my favorites are I have always had a special connection to More than a feeling I also love the Don t Look Back journey It s Easy combo Hitch a ride is one of my biggest favorites The lead switching at the end of thesong is wonderful Feelin Satisfied is the best driving song I have ever heard It makes me want to drive down the highway at MPH every time I hear it On the rd album I love Hollyann and
