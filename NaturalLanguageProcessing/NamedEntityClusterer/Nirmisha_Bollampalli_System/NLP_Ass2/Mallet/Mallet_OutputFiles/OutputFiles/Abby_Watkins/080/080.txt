September abcproject September an adventure in learning September Tourist symbolism has not caught on in the far reaches of Western Australia A simple roadsign the only break in an endless horizon indicated we had crossed the Tropic of Capricorn for the second time The coastal region directly below the tropics is unique in that it doesn t experience the dual seasons of the wet and the dry The climate is close to ideal and the city of Carnarvon makes the most of a year round growing season with luxuriant plantations that provide all the ingredients for bowls of fruit salad The wide streets were lined with dazzling displays of poincettas bougainvilleas and hibiscus and we saw green lawns again thanks to the plentiful supply of water provided by the Gascoyne River We made the most of the opportunity to s le the fresh fish and prawns that provide another thriving industry to the region Carnarvon Bush Biker Boundary Fence I reached the Overlander Roadhouse hot tired and dry after km of crosswinds to be met by a sign that warned Do not ask for water as refusal may offend We avoided the prospect of being offended by having an le supply of Carnarvon water and enough time in the day to ride another kms before finding a place to pull off the highway to c for the night We had surprise visitors in the morning when two emus walked into c at first oblivious to our presence but then dancing off in their strange swaying bobbing wingless gait as they became aware of us It was a busy morning as their vacated spots were filled by a herd of wild goats We were to see large numbers of feral goats and sheep in the next few days until reaching the Murchison Boundary fence that stretches for km across Western Australia providing a barrier to stop them munching on the greening vegetation that met us as we headed south Wildflowers are a major reason people travel to Western Australia in the spring The more we followed the compass south the more colourful and prolific the roadside displays of wildflowers became The isolation of Western Australia is a factor in the uniqueness and variety of the species to be found here numbering up to Approaching Kalbarri National Park the road was lined with the silvertipped branches of the smokebush and yellow flowering wattle with clusters of red banksias grevilleas kangaroo paws and patches of everlastings in carpets of brilliant pink yellow and purple It was a spectacular showcase that slowed our progress as June insisted on identifying each new species she saw At a roadside reststop I caught up to June who introduced me to a fellow wanderer Mary Ebbott Mary s daughter Abby Watkins lives in Golden and along with Rick Marshall spends much of her time in the mountains climbing and exploring We look forward to making a connection with them upon our return Kalbarri is one of those jewels on a traveller s roadmap that makes you want to hang around for a while longer Surrounded on one side by heathlands of exquisite wildflowers and on another by the deep red rock gorges of the Murchison River and yet on another side by an ocean that has carved a jagged coastline of red banded cliffs Kalbarri has managed to retain a low profile village atmosphere that provides a sheltered harbour from the storms of the world It may not have appeared so idyllic for the first settlers in the area Back in two mutinous crew members from the Dutch East India trading ship the Batavia were put ashore here giving them the distinction of being the first European settlers albeit unwillingly in this country yet to be discovered by Captain Cook Kalbari Cliffs The Batavia shortly thereafter hit a reef and sank as did numerous other early visiting ships to the region The constant pounding of the Indian Ocean surf has claimed massive chunks of red sandstone and white limestone from the towering cliffs continuously moulding the landscape into caves natural bridges and rugged coastal gorges One of the trips most memorable meals was eaten at Finlay s B B Q in Kalbarri Aussie style cooked in a tin shed and eaten outside under the stars on a sand floor sitting around a c fire The pile of seafood and salad was staggering and entertainment was provided by anyone who wanted to get up and play an instrument or sing Need a napkin grab a toilet roll and drinking water came in wine bottles You couldn t complain about the service in this restaurant there wasn t any If you didn t serve yourself you went without We thought we had taken a wrong turn out of Kalbarri and had somehow ended up in England The countryside quite suddenly became rolling green farmland in total contrast to the scenery of the past months North ton was a stopover where we visited the local school Set in rolling hills dotted with sheep and smothered in purple wildflowers it is an agricultural village with a population of and quaint sandstone block buildings Teacher Ann Williams arranged for us to give a presentation to a large group of students ranging in age from grades to They were a very attentive and well behaved group of students and it was most rewarding to visit a school that my former students had been emailing from Kimberley Following the coast road down to Perth we c ed overnight in a shanty town of lobster fisherman shacks Lobster fishing is big business which is encouraging the haphazard growth of squatter s shacks along the remote beaches Government bulldozers were busy at work on a not very popular clean up c aign North ton Norh ton School Pinnacles Desert The southern beaches have the whitest sand we had ever seen due to a high concentration of lime in the region It is also one of the richest areas for plant species in the world with the heathlands boasting more than recorded species more than all the native plants recorded for Great Britain It is difficult to fathom since the sandy soils are extremely low in nutrients and don t hold moisture well but the plant life has adapted to this adversity and evolved in amazing numbers We discovered an interesting desert landscape when we visited the Pinnacles Desert near Cervantes Huge limestone pillars rise out of the surrounding desert sands resembling ancient tombstones The early Dutch explorers seeing them from offshore thought were seeing the remains of an ancient city It is time for a break and we went in search of a T V to watch the opening ceremonies of the Sydney Olympic Games It certainly was a spectacular opening and the first few days of competition indicate that this Olympics will be a very successful event Pinnacles Questions for students to ponder On a map locate the geographical position that we crossed for the second time at degrees minutes South and degrees minutes East How soon before Captain Cook s discovery of Australia did the earliest European visitors the two mutinous crew members from the Batavia land on the west coast What is the only other city in the southern hemisphere to host an Olympic Games In what year How many sports will be featured in Olympic competition in Sydney How many countries are competing in this Olympic games One of the sports that Australian students play is cricket What is the name for the three sticks that the batsmen defend Australia has six states and two territories Name them Which state is the biggest in area HOME Journal Entries Photo Album Present
