year her first magazine feature was published and the year she learned to swim She died in but left behind many ways to know her letters manuscripts journals and with failing eyesight her last written words the day before she died With me she left indelible memories especially of her few months visit to our home in the winter of Some time on her return home she wrote back to us of being so happy to have had Iris Teta to read to Grandmother Eubank and my father were published writers of fiction and non fiction Their stories were in newspapers and magazines in the U S and Canada She and my father also shared an avid interest in ancient Egyptian culture and architecture By the time I was born the family had already selected my name it was to be Rachel Jane for my Eubank and Jones great grandmothers Daddy and Grandma however became rebels and instead gave me a name from one of their favorite works of fiction about an ancient Egyptian princess Teta who travels through time to reappear in the future as Iris Mrs Fanny D Eubank Note The Bridge of Time by William Henry Warner New York Scott Seltzer On visits to her cottage a mile or so from town we would settle outside on the porch swing and chairs or inside on the sofa and Daddy Grandma and Mama would talk about writing family politics and recent reading I would listen A year or two before we moved away my mother was our town s news correspondent to The Asheville Citizen Mims loved visiting Grandma and helping her with the garden It was Grandma who helped put together his first st and coin collection and encouraged him to continue Those first collections grew over the years into his coin investment and appraisal business He would spend a few weeks at a time with Grandma and she was so happy to have his company Often they d walk the winding road down to the main highway from the cottage pick up a few groceries at the old commissary and start back up the road About halfway along the road stood a great white rock with streaks of grey strata through it Grandma and Mims would stop to rest and have a bite to eat there That ancient rock is still standing by the road though tilted some by a dozer Houses have since been built and cars now up and down the road But the rock still has company from the bicycle riders and a sprinkling of walkers and joggers who may at times stop to rest by it The cottage is still at the top of the hill Mims died in but he leaves a daughter and a wife who continues his life long business Growing up studying family photographs I saw the resemblance between Mims my brother and Mims my grandfather I feel that in many ways my brother reminded Grandma of Grandfather Eubank whom she had divorced in and who had returned to the family two years later Grandfather Eubank died in Fanny died in They are buried side by side in a cemetery in Knoxville several miles from where they had lived some of their happiest married days Our mother s Aunt Frances at thirty the year of her marriage to D W Whisenhunt After her husband s death in during the depths of the Depression Aunt Frances completed a correspondence course in nursing and worked for thirty five years as a licensed practical nurse with private patients from among the most prominent families in Asheville North Carolina She was with us until Through the years she would visit several times a year and always on Christmas She was adventurous and daring After retirement in her mid sixties she traveled with us on several family vacations On an excursion through the western states she spent evenings writing dozens of postcards to Mrs Frances B Whisenhunt friends and family back home about the glorious landscapes she was seeing She kept up or ahead of us on tours of Washington D C and New York City where she climbed in the heat and humidity of July the spiral and narrow iron steps up to the crown of the Statue of Liberty On visits she came with a fifth of White Port packed neatly in her square black suitcase which always smelled of Cashmere Bouquet soap At some time during the visit most likely soon after she arrived she and my mother would sit down at the dining table and share a glass or two of Port They would share this rare time chuckling about one thing or another It was a special time for both My mother was eager to catch up on family news back home in Asheville Swannanoa and Black Mountain And Aunt Frances was interested to hear what was new with our family As a little girl growing up listening to their good time together I learned to appreciate the joy of good conversation Betty Jean William and Bonnie s first She was about two years old here It was and the little dress was a light aqua blue silk crepe Our mother kept the little dress like new and Betty still has it packed neatly away Aunt Hat had given it to her after Betty Jean and her mother had arrived at the Southern Railway Depot in Knoxville homesick for Aunt Frances and Grandmother Eubank Betty has always loved pretty dresses and shoes She remembers one shoe story William and Bonnie used to tell It was The Depression had worsened and William and his young family had moved back near his sister and mother William Mims had been born in January On Sundays especially Betty Jean looked forward to visits with Uncle George and Aunt Trilby George operated for his mother s family the Blacks of Myersville Pennsylvania one of the two major manufactories in town During the Depression at those times when all operations at the plant were shut down Uncle George always made sure William had an income Aunt Trilby and Uncle George s children Billy and Fanny Sue were about twelve and eight years old in It was happily customary after dinner on Sunday for all to get in the car and go for ice cream at one of the local drugstores On one of these trips Uncle George noticed Fanny Sue s shoes to be looking a little worn and said to Trilby Mother don t you think Sister needs a new pair of shoes They look a little worn At once Betty Jean stretched out her little legs to see how her shoes compared to Fanny Sue s which were said to be worn and in need of replacement Not to pass up a gorgeous opportunity Betty Jean immediately chimed in moving her feet back and forth to attract attention Well I think I need some new shoes too Everybody got a big laugh though Bonnie was some embarassed at Betty Jean being so forward William didn t actually hear Betty Jean s comment for he hadn t been able to hear well since the War But the comment was appreciated by Uncle George and Betty Jean s new shoes were delivered to the house within a few days Betty Jean recalls another shoe delivery that has stuck in her memory all these years In Betty Jean was twelve years old and growing into a young lady prissy she says with long and thick dark auburn hair When the knock came at the door Bonnie asked Betty Jean to see who was at the door Immediately Betty Jean was making her way to the door and eating a prune at the same time Looking through the door window she saw a neighbor Mr Bristol who was a supervisor at Uncle George s plant and she opened the door He had in his hands what looked to be a shoe box in wrapping paper Betty Jean your Uncle George asked that I drop this package off to you on my way home he said It was at this point that Betty Jean swallowed the prune pit Mr Bristol and Bonnie who had joined them watched as Betty Jean excitedly opened the package She barely noticed the pit going down When she opened the box resting in a nest of white tissue paper was a delicate pair of black patent leather dress up pumps She said it was the little raised heel that sent her immediately dreaming of all those parties and socials to come Those were her first pair of dress up shoes The swallowed pit and this story became a special memory Looking back now we think behind this surprise delivery there must have been a conspiracy between William Uncle George and Mr Bristol at the plant and Bonnie at home Bonnie Katherine Jones b March d February My mother would say often that the very happiest time for her was childhood free to be herself no pressure to be something for someone else just sunlight and friends Bonnie K Eubank and son George and the many cousins and the extended family who loved her In later life after she had married and had four children I knew that grown up happy time for her had come to be the apple tree the singing and the gold transformed from those carefree days of childhood I saw her lovely face dance in laughter when all the children and the grandchildren were bustling about She seemed once again spirited back to the exuberance of childhood she so often talked about She may at times have thought she left those times of joy among the meadows behind long ago But she hadn t They surfaced so often In the photo above in still lovely at eighty three my brother George took Mama for a spin in his new red sports car Jones Joshua Jones c
