Bouldering and Rock Climbing at Webcrag Skiers Rally Against Recent Yellowstone Decision More than Protest Court Ruling Overturning Parks Snowmobile Ban West Yellowstone Montana More than skiers from around the nation gathered in Yellowstone National Park to speak out against Tuesday s federal court ruling that again allows snowmobile use in the park We must preserve this park now before it s too late said Haidee Wilson from North Carolina This park is a national possibly even an international gem and we must do what we can to ensure that future generations can visit Yellowstone in its original state The rally hosted by Winter Wildlands Alliance WWA took place just inside the park s West Gate which is now the entryway for up to snowmobiles per day On Tuesday U S District Judge Clarence Brimmer issued a temporary restraining order that suppresses a pending ban on snowmobiling in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks Brimmer ruled that without the order companies that rely on snowmobiling in the parks would suffer irreparable harm because of lost business I m upset that Brimmer s decision completely ignores us skiers and snowshoers said Mack Bray from Jackson Hole Wyoming We stay in hotels eat in restaurants and have money that is as green as anyone else s But we can t recreate here in the midst of pollution and engine noise Without a ban there s just no point in us coming here A Dec ruling by U S District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan reinstated a Clinton era plan to phase out snowmobile use in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks The effect of the court s ruling would have been to reduce snowmobile use in the parks this year by half and eliminate snowmobile use next year Many residents of the Park s gateway community of West Yellowstone expressed concerns that the Dec ruling would reduce winter tourism dollars WWA s event was to be an attempt at re introducing human powered winter recreationists to the park Many skiers and snowshoers avoided Yellowstone in the winter because it was previously considered to be a haven of motorized recreation Winter Wildlands expects the long term effect of a snowmobile ban in the parks to actually be an increase in tourism dollars as more user groups flock to a safer quieter more pristine Yellowstone while snowmobilers continue to utilize the more than miles of snowmobile trails just outside the Park WWA officials estimated that the attendees of their celebration pumped more than into local economies Skiers and snowshoers have told us they re ready to return to places like West Yellowstone and we re confident they ll play a key role in expanding the community s tourism base once snowmobile use is banned from our parks said WWA Executive Director Sally Grimes With a complete phase out of snowmobiles still scheduled for next winter Grimes said it is critical that the Park Service Congress local businesses and government leaders and recreation organizations like WWA work together to find new ways to draw more winter visitors to West Yellowstone and other gateway communities Winter Wildlands is calling for a modernization of the Yellowstone snowcoach fleet and better education of the public on the diverse winter recreation opportunities in and around Yellowstone Based in Boise Idaho Winter Wildlands represents more than million skiers snowshoers snowboarders and

visit www winterwildlands org Skiers Say Court Setback Underscores Need for Yellowstone Rally Expected in Park for Valentine acirc euro s Day Show of Support for Yellowstone WEST YELLOWSTONE MT Fresh from a U S District Court ruling that suddenly and dramatically increased the number of snowmobiles allowed in Yellowstone National Park the rest of this winter skiers and other winter recreationists are coming to Yellowstone this weekend to rally in support of the park and re assert their demand to eliminate the machines from the park The ruling in Wyoming is a huge disappointment especially since four federal judges in Washington D C soundly rejected the governments push to keep snowmobiles in Yellowstone Winter Wildlands Alliance Executive Director Sally Grimes said But this setback only underscores the need for skiers snowshoers and other non motorized snowsports enthusiasts from around the nation to rally once again in Yellowstone in support of the park and all it represents The fight for a clean healthy and quiet Yellowstone is far from over and we are more energized than ever As it did last Presidents Day weekend Winter Wildlands Alliance is inviting members and supporters from across the United States to gather in Yellowstone on Valentines Day to voice their support for the park An estimated supporters are expected to attend both a Friday night pre rally reception and the main event on Saturday morning just inside Yellowstones west entrance The rally comes just four days after U S District Court Judge Clarence Brimmer in Wyoming blocked the phase out of snowmobile use underway in Yellowstone by ruling in favor of the snowmobile industry and the state of Wyoming The snowmobile industry and the state are battling to keep snowmobiles in Yellowstone despite National Park Service studies that show the way to best protect the park is to ban the machines Winter Wildlands joined five national and regional conservation and environmental groups in fighting to restore the three year old snowmobile phase out launched by the Clinton administration but overturned by the Bush White House U S District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington agreed with the coalition in December overturning the Bush administration plan to allow more snowmobiles in Yellowstone and ordering the Park Service to begin the phase out That ruling was later upheld by an appellate panel But this week the Wyoming judge halted the phase out prompting the Park Service to immediately begin allowing vastly more machines into the park than allowed so far this winter The Park Services answer to this controversy is no answer at all Grimes said It is now allowing machines into Yellowstone up from the that were allowed before this ruling Those who have visited the park so far this winter have been amazed at how much quieter and cleaner it is this year Now we are back to business as usual Yellowstone will be louder dirtier and less healthy this weekend than it was last weekend This is Americas park and Americans have spoken overwhelmingly in favor of the snowmobile ban that the Park Service says is needed to protect Yellowstone Instead of looking for ways to get more snowmobiles into Yellowstone we should be focusing on finding the resources needed to get more visitors into the park on snowcoaches just as the Park Service suggested three years and millions of dollars worth of studies ago During the course of this weekend Winter Wildlands will be encouraging Yellowstone rally participants to redouble efforts to contact their elected officials in Washington and to step up lobbying on behalf of a snowmobile free Yellowstone Winter Wildlands has joined such groups as The Wilderness Society National Parks Conservation Association Greater Yellowstone Coalition Natural Resources Defense Council the Sierra Club and the Natural Trails and Waters Coalition in c aigning to remove snowmobiles from the two parks as recommended by the Park Service in before the Park Service reversed itself after being sued by the snowmobile industry With thousands of miles of groomed snowmobile trails surrounding Yellowstone there are le opportunities

economies BOISE ID A federal court ruling against the Bush administration s snowmobile plan for Yellowstone National Park will create short term hardship for some businesses outside Yellowstone but will be a boon to others and presents a rare opportunity for towns such as West Yellowstone to diversify their economies the nation s first and only organization representing non motorized winter recreationists said We understand there will be some local economic disruption as a result of this ruling but we also know skiers and other winter recreation enthusiasts will flock to Yellowstone and its gateway communities once snowmobiles are no longer in the park said Winter Wildlands Alliance Executive Director Sally Grimes Skiers have been telling us they re ready to return to places like West Yellowstone and we re confident they ll play a key role as the community expands its tourism base Winter Wildlands based in Boise represents more than million skiers snowshoers snowboarders and other non motorized snowsports enthusiasts It is the lone recreation group among the six plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit over the National Park Service s winter use plan for Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks U S District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan on Wednesday set aside the Park Service s plan to allow nearly snowmobiles a day into Yellowstone and Grand Teton reinstating a Clinton era plan to phase out snowmobile use in both parks The effect of the court s ruling is to reduce snowmobile use in the parks this year by half eliminating it next year The important thing for Yellowstone and for those who want to enjoy its natural beauty in the winter is to move ahead as soon as possible toward replacing snowmobiles with more snowcoaches to allow all Americans to visit Yellowstone in the winter Grimes said Yellowstone is not closed this winter nor will it be closed next winter All Americans will still enjoy access to this special place Now that the court has ruled it s up to all of us to work with the Park Service and the communities surrounding these magnificent parks to expand winter recreation opportunities in and around the parks Grimes said it s critical that the Park Service Congress local businesses and government leaders and snowmobile organizations work together to find new ways to draw more winter visitors to West Yellowstone and other gateway communities That includes askig Congress for more funds to expand the Yellowstone snowcoach fleet and to better educate the public on diverse winter recreation opportunities in and around Yellowstone For instance the Park Service was prepared to spend more than million in tax dollars this winter to assess snowmobile pollution levels and other impacts and to hire more law enforcement officers That money can now be used to expand local economies The visiting public needs to be made aware that tomorrow next week and throughout the winter they can continue to visit Yellowstone s popular attractions Grimes said Skiers and snowshoers will return and we think this can be a win win case for everyone It s our hope that rather than being known as just the snowmobile capitol of the world towns like West Yellowstone will become known as the Winter Wonderland of the world Other groups involved in the Yellowstone snowmobile case are Greater Yellowstone Coalition National Parks Conservation Association The Wilderness Society Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club The organizations were represented by Earthjustice Grimes said Winter Wildlands plans to hold its annual skier rally for Yellowstone as scheduled this Valentine s Day WWA expects more than skiers snowshoers and others to fill West Yellowstone hotels and restaurants over the long Presidents Day weekend as they did last year in a show of economic support for local businesses WWA officials will also seek to meet with local business leaders on how skiers can play a role in expanding the town s winter economy Founded in

Management BLM is developing a travel management plan for off road vehicles ORVs and other recreation use on acres of interspersed private state and BLM lands between Canon City and Cripple Creek This area is known as the Gold Belt Travel Management Area and it includes the Shelf Road climbing area Low population and rugged terrain have kept most of these lands relatively pristine However the area has recently been discovered by growing numbers of off road vehicle users ORV advocates are well organized vocal and have been lobbying the BLM for greater access Intensive ORV use will have an adverse effect on the Shelf climbing experience degrade wildlife habitat and water quality and increase noise pollution and soil erosion The BLM is now in the process of deciding how much of the area will be available to ORVs and how much will remain wild and provide solitude The BLM has held two scoping meetings to identify important issues and develop alternatives and is now in the process of developing the Travel Management Plan Comments will be accepted throughout the planning process Please encourage the BLM to restrict ORV use to existing roads and most importantly not to allow their use in or near the Shelf Road climbing area AccessFund org You can submit your comments via phone or in writing via mail email or fax to BLM Royal Gorge Field Office Gold Belt TMP comments Attn Dave
