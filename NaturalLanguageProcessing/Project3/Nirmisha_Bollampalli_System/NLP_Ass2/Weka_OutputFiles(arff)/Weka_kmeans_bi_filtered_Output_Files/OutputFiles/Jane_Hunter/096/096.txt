Ewing b in Bedford CO VA Finis Ewing Rev b Jul in Bedford CO VA From Betty J Evans With the exception of a few birth dated very few or such as that none of the information comes from the internet or WFT CD S I have done all of my own research the old fashioned way since old habits are hard to kick in regard to the Ewings and my information basically comes from records found in The Ewing Genealogy with Cognate Brenches from records I have found in various history books and from a few obituaries furnished by Ewing descendants or obits from historical societies obits in connection with later generations of the family that is That isn t too say the records are without error but they are as close as I can get to the actual facts with the material there is out there to work with So many of the Ewing men were prominent politicians attorneys etc that there has been a lot written about them in the early history of our nation but finding information about the women in the family is a whole different ballgame The women present a real challenge and I hope to learn more about some of them in the future Robert Ewing the emigrant ancestor was born at or near coleraine in Londonderry County Ireland and came to America with his older brother Charles Ewing about the period Robert and Charles were said to be cousins of the emigrant Nathaniel Ewing On their arrival in America they first went to Nathaniel s home in cecil County Maryland but shortly after they accompanied their cousin the emigrant James Nathaniel s half brother to what became prince Edward County virginia Later they joined a new adventurous colony and settled near the Peaks of Otter in Bedford County virginia where they remained the rest of their lives according to The Ewing Genealogy with Cognate Branches by Kettridge

Robert Ewing qualified as one of the Justices of the County Court for Bedford County asd was serving in and Robert and his brother Charles ranked among the better farmers of Bedford County virginia both owning considerable land At the time of his death Robert Ewing left more than acres of land to be sold and the money invested some of it in land in the Far West for his sons Chatham and Finis Robert s Will dated March with a codicil dated May was filed for probate in the Bedford County Court on June reportedly naming eight sons and three daughters as heirs indicating one daughter was deceased previous to her father the deceased daughter being Sidney Ann Ewing The Will disposed of considerable land both in Virginia and Kentucky the ownership in Kentucky being explained by the fact that much of Kentucky was carved out of Augusta County Virginia Robert Ewing died in May or June in Bedford County His wife Mary reportedly died three years later in and is buried beside her husband

GRANT Kings Grant otherwise known as the Old Turner Place was built circa Located in the community of Henry Virginia it is situated on partof a tract of land originally consisting of approximately acresacquired around and a decade or so thereafter by the pioneerShadrack Turner ca and his wife Anne A Royal Land Grant from King George II ofEngland reigned this portion has remained in thedescendants possession continuously since then now almost two and ahalf centuries including the present owner Dr Harry Lee King Jr ofthe eighth generation Some of the early tract dates from a grant from the newly formedCommonwealth of Virginia to Josiah Turner I born ca forservice in the American Revolution The original document bearing ahandsome red seal and signed by President Thomas Jefferson when Governorof Virginia is still in the possession of the King family It is believed that thepresent house was built by one of Shadrack Turner s sons who latermigrated West or moved to a nearby county Constructed of thirty foot long hand hewn oak logs from twelve tofifteen inches wide with two stairways and nine foot ceilings the mainpart of the structure once had a A roof front porch a long dinning roomat the rear with another porch running its length to which was joined abreezeway and a spacious log bodied kitchen All the exterior was coveredwith white painted clapboard and accented with green window shutters Interestingly among the many outbuildings only the smokehouse remains the smoke house corncrib and chicken house identical log buildingsresembling the kitchen and located near the dwelling all boasted thesame carefully crafted decorative moldings as the main house and thecorncrib had a basement The sitting room mantel revealed an interestingfeature upon its being

page CALEB BAKER SR Family tradition states that Caleb Baker married Martha Brooks in England and as she had a grandson by the name of Brooks Baker this would seem likely to be true Caleb and Martha Baker reared a family of eight children Samuel Henry Abraham Caleb Jr Ruth Mary Martha and Ester It is not known by the writer to whom the three older sons Samuel Henry and Abraham married but Samuel s will probated in Prince Edward County Virginia March mentions his wife Christian and Children Samuel John Glover Robert Caleb Martha Ewing Elizabeth C bell and Sarah Crockett Martha married Charles Ewing Ruth married Samuel Johnston Mary married Robert Ewing Ester married Samuel Wallace of Amelia County Virginia Caleb Jr married Catherine Hodnett of Buckingham County Virginia William H Whitsitt of Richmond College Virginia writing of the Baker family states that Caleb Baker s will probated in Prince Edward County Virginia April Is a clear and informing document and is worthy of careful study in every instance in the will and sometimes in the deeds recorded in Amelia County He spells his name not Baker but Beaker that appears to have been in his view an important consideration His wife and children and neighbors had no scruples about recording the name Baker but the father could never be reconciled to that usage The circumstances appears to indicate that the name was originally the German name Becher which is the same as the Latin word Bacar and the English word Beaker and signifies a vessel for drinking wine The ancestors of Caleb Baker were probably cup bearers at some Court of high or low degree and took their name from the function which they there fulfilled The well known family name of blankenbaker seems also to refer to the same origin these who bore it feeling a special pride in maintaining their beaker in a condition of immaculate whiteness But many a Blankenbaker has found by experience that people in general have small appreciation of the nicer points in philology The descendants of Caleb Baker made a like discovery and were compelled to submit when the name should be pronounced and written Baker instead of Beaker They might have saved themselves in a measure if they had Anglicized the name in the form of Beecher but few of those who employed it in that form would be enabled to make out its original meaning It would be well however if all who bear the name of Caleb Baker could be informed of these simple facts in connection with it History is worth preserving for its own sake and the truth of it should be duly honored The American Historical

sons were gunsmiths They were commissioned by the King of England to make firearms for the Colonies At the time of the Revolution the Bakers joined with the Colonies against England On Aug Robert Baker petitioned Jacob Taylor surveyor for William Penn for permission to erect a gun boring mill on Pequea Creek In Feb iron ore was found near the site of the Baker land Robert and his son sought and received permission to mine the ore for commercial use The ore they mined was reduced to bar stock available to gun manufacturers This was the first discovery of ore in the county and predated later gunsmith operations closer to Lancaster Robert Baker and his father before him were gunsmiths credited with inventing the Baker Long Rifle a report given to the Kentucky Rifle s Association in It seems that the Association had employed Mr Dyke to do some research for them They wanted him to see if he could find out the person or persons responsible for making the first Pennsylvania Rifles or what was sometimes called the Kentucky Rifle Mr Dyke in his report states We feel as though these early gunsmiths came into Chaster Pennsylvania or New Castle Delaware from abroad and migrated up the Susquehanna River to where the Pequea flows into it and set up shop for making guns He goes on to say that Robert Baker came into Lancaster County Court on August and asked permission to erect a gun foring mill at the mouth of Pequea Creek on his land Permission was granted Robert Baker and his son Caleb set up their gunshop and operated it until Provided by Patty McNary Greer Robert Baker Sr
