did inherit from her mother then Marchioness of Winchester and Thomas had led average lives for children of their era and station and had also survived the third sibling a second daughter who passed on at an early age His education went as planned as his father would say where upon at the age of fifteen he was had been educated out of Hart Hall in Oxford Two years later in at the age of seventeen he left his childhood home and took residence in London where he began pursuing his life as a poet and playwright He received the bulk his wealth from his father Sir Richard Sackville a wealthy landowner whose acquisitiveness earned him the nickname of Fill Sack and was noted for reasons of his great wealth and vast patrimony H e continue to live in such a manner as his father did knowing how to spend his moneys well and in such a way that he and his family could live in a comfortable fashion At nineteen years of age in he met fell in love with and married the daughter of a member of the Privy Council under Queen Mary Cicely Baker of Kent His father s exclusion from office under Mary did not significantly delay Thomas Sackville s entry upon public life for it was not long after his coming of age that he sat in his first Parliament His election at the beginning of for East Grinstead where his father had wielded great influence had the appearance of a safeguard against his failing to carry off the knighthood for Westmoreland after he had done so and entered the House as junior knight for that shire the vacancy at East Grinstead was filled by another Sackville nominee Thomas Farnham The circumstances of Sackville s election for Westmoreland are not made easier of explanation by the damaged state of the return on which the surname is represented only by the fragment sa A century ago the name was read as salkeld The accuracy of this reading is borne out by the appearance of that name afterwards erased and replaced by sackvell on one of the two remaining copies of the Crown Office list the other and later copy has sackveld alone It is thus possible that a Thomas Salkeld presumably of the prominent Westmoreland family of that name was elected but was afterwards superseded by Sackville What is more likely however is that Sackville was elected and that instead of his unfamiliar name its near counterpart was entered on the return to be copied on the Crown Office list and only corrected when Sackville appeared in the House Who procured his election is a matter of speculation Neither he nor his fellow knight Anthony Kempe another Sussex man had any standing in Westmoreland but both could claim a marriage connection with Henry Clifford Earl of Cumberland hereditary sheriff of the county and with his father in law the rd Lord Dacre of Gillesland Cumberland must also have had dealings with both Sackville s father and ex chancellor or augmentations and his father in law Sir John Baker one of whom doubtless made the approach For Sackville as for Kempe a knighthood of the shire was not to recur he was to sit as a burgess in the first two Elizabethan Parliaments and in the third he took his seat in the Lords Sackville had appeared on the pardon roll in Oct as of London On Mar together with Thomas Swynton he purchased various properties in Kent and Sussex for In co operation with Thomas Norton he wrote The Tragedie of Gorboduc but he handed

Parliament this time for Aylesbury When he became thirty one years of age he was knighted and raised to peerage as Lord Buckhurst which did take place on the eighth day of Jun of that year One year prior to receiving the title of Lord Buckhurst Queen Elizabeth awarded a piece of property to keeping known as Knole Much of the fabric of Knole dates from the second half of the fifteenth century On Jun William Fiennes sold the estate s d to Thomas Bourchier Archbishop of Canterbury and for a brief period in Lord Chancellor of England Between that date and his death in Bourchier built himself a substantial but relatively austere palace grouped around a series of courtyards and containing all of the elements that one would expect to see in the house of an important medieval prelate a great hall with a day parlour and first floor solar at one end and kitchens and domestic offices at the other a chapel and lodgings for his large household When Bourchier died at Knole he left the estate to the See of Canterbury and it functioned as an archiepiscopal palace until when Henry VIII bullied Thomas Cranmer into presenting it to the Crown The King considerably enlarged the house by building three new ranges of lodgings and a turreted and crenellated gatehouse in the front of the Archbishop s original gatehouse thus forming what is now known as the Green Court the main entrance court at Knole After his death the house went through a rather confused series of occupancies Edward VI assigned it to John Dudley Duke of Northumberland who for some reason returned it two years later Mary he granted it to Cardinal Pole for life in when he died in Nov on the same day as the Queen it reverted to the Crown Elizabeth granted it to John Dudley s son Robert Earl of Leicester who promptly sublet it before returning it still sublet in In Jun the Queen presented the estate to his keeping under whom Knole has finally settled down to a more stable period of ownership But throughout his career as one of her Majesty s chief advisers he had been unable to even live at Knole in the stead he had managed replace the old Archbishop s palace with a Theobalds or a Holdenby for his Queen s entertainment Although he had been granted the house and estate in it currently occupied by the Lennard family tenants who had moved in as the Earl of Leicester handed the property back to the Crown

In he became a member of her Majesty s Privy Council and became employed as Commissioner at state trials As a member of her Majesty s Privy Council he was considered a prot g e of William Cecil Baron
