Info Hello to all our friends and sympathetic listeners It s been too long once again since we ve been in touch with you but it is with gratitude that we sit down to write you now We re grateful to all those of you who joined us on climbs trips and adventures during the last months We re also grateful for the places we ve had the privilege to go and the things we ve been able to attempt and often achieve Since we wrote you last July we ve had another great summer season of guiding in the Alps an attempt on Cho Oyu and a fairly tranquil fall and winter season mostly at home unusual for us We enjoyed an uncommonly good early season snowpack here in the Sierra timely for us since we had bought season s passes at Mammoth Mountain at fire sale prices last spring Alan Maurer and Mark found this weather on Mont Blanc Photo Info Here s the lowdown on the last few months activities July August Alps Alan Maurer of Salt Lake City was joined by Mark for an attempt on Mont Blanc in mid July A monster dump of snow made the hike up to the Go ucirc ter Hut truly a mountaineering experience in and of itself and the weather continued too poor to make a realistic attempt After returning to Chamonix in defeat they scooted up the Cosmiques Ar ecirc te as a consolation prize a cold climb on a brilliant clear day After that Susan Lowery and her husband Roy Zagieboylo hooked up with Mark for climbing in the Chamonix area They accomplished a lot in a few short days including the Petite Aiguille Verte beware Chris Kulp the gauntlet has been thrown down Pointes Lachenal the Cosmiques Ar ecirc te the SE Ridge of the Tour Ronde the Index the Midi Plan traverse and Mont Blanc du Tacul on an arctic weather day Meanwhile Joan Sutherland of Groton New York was climbing with Kathy This was a first time trip together for these two and they too accomplished a lot both in the summits department and in the realm of NYT Sunday Crossword Puzzles a fetish of Kathy s They started out in the Chamonix area a traverse of the French Italian frontier ridge to the summit of the Aiguille d Entr egrave ves was done in two separate half day installments combined with other climbs the SE ridge of the Tour Ronde the Cosmiques Ar ecirc te and Mont Blanc via the traverse of Mont Blanc du Tacul and Mont Maudit on the descent from which Joan had to shepherd a suddenly flu stricken and helpless Kathy back to her hotel bed before heading over to Zermatt where they had the great luck of good weather and conditions on the Matterhorn Joan and Kathy were thrilled to succeed on both Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn a combination requiring both great stamina and excellent luck with the weather Joan had both Susan and Roy on Mont Blanc du Tacul Photo Info Alas such luck was not to bless Jon Penn during his second attempt to climb the Matterhorn this time with Kathy Jon is ready willing and itchin to get that peak but a truly huge dump of snow put it out of reach during the time he had for it this year Jon did get in a climb of the Wellenkuppe and Obergabelhorn a big climb with great views involving plenty of variety and challenge both on rock and on icy snow slopes The route was generously smattered with ice and newly fallen snow which along with a chill stiff wind made for a tough long and satisfying climb An attempt the following day on the Zinalrothorn was foiled by the same multi day storm that thwarted the Matterhorn attempt as well Instead after an amusing drizzly slippery descent of the via ferrata in the Gorner Gorge they headed over to Monte Rosa only to be turned back by an icy flesh freezing wind Sometimes the mountains can be cruel While Kathy and Jon were freezing their butts in Zermatt Emery Dameron was met by Mark in Chamonix where they climbed the Index and Cosmiques Ar ecirc te despite a nagging knee injury of Emery s Chris Kulp the intrepid was back in the Alps with Mark in August They got in several great rock routes before a variation of the Chamonix Plague that was still circulating put Chris down for several days and foiled an attempt on the Meije in the Ecrins region near La Grave Feeling better for the Innominata route on Mont Blanc they were turned back by weather that was too good The hot sun made crossing the central couloir high on the route inadvisable Still among the great routes they explored together were the Aiguille du Peigne The Fl egrave che Rousse on the Aiguille d Argenti egrave re Mani Puliti in the Aiguilles Rouges the Tour des Crochues by the Galbert route and Tchao Godillo in the Col de la Colombi egrave re Chris Kulp on the Traverse of the Aiguille d Entr egrave ves The Aiguille verte in the background Photo Info Emery on the Aiguille de l Index Photo Info Chris Kulp on Mani Puliti a great rock route in the Aiguilles Rouges Photo Info Chris hams it up on the summit of the Aiguille d Argenti egrave re Photo Info Finally Kathy headed over to the Dolomites to join a contingent of the Latham family Andy wife Jan and sons Adam and Stephen They had fun in the sun climbing sport and multi pitch routes on fine limestone and s ling some of the airy exciting and historic via ferrata near the town of Cortina enjoying great pasta and coffee After a day of sight seeing en famille in Venice Andy and Kathy saw Jan and the boys off at the Milan airport and drove to Switzerland for a last few productive days climbing before their time ran out They had good weather and quickly climbed the Jungfrau followed by the Eiger via the Mittellegi Ridge and South Ridge descent This exciting extremely exposed ridge climb was a long committing beautiful climb on a gorgeous day Following that with one day left they drove over to Piz Bernina and climbed the beautiful mixed ridge on the Piz Palu before parting company in Milan Cho Oyu as seen from Base C The wind blows a big lenticular over the summit Photo Info Chris and Kathy on Mount Conness Photo Info A Winter at Home mostly We hadn t been home long before Chris Kulp made the drive over the hill for a quick climb of the North Ridge of Conness a great fall day This winter we have been working away on a writing project and skiing

visiting climbers These events featuring auctions and a bar stocked by a local brewery cheap gear and free beer benefit a local women s shelter and every year raise more money for a great cause Kathy says she feels honored and privileged to be a part of this event which she looks forward to every February Now we re breaking in our tight little rock shoes and trying to get out rock climbing in the
