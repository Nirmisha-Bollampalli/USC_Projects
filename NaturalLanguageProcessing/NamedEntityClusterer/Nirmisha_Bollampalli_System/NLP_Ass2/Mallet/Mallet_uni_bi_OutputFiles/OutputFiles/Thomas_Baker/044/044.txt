Cantrell of Wilkes and Ashe County North Carolina Home gt Surnames gt Baker gt Thomas Baker Children Researcher List Register Report A Note about sources How to contact me Home The author Marty Grant is not related to Thomas Baker as far as can be proven I have a feeling that he is a cousin to my ancestor Jacob Baker but no proof of that yet They may not be related at all Note Much family data is found in Revolutionary War Pension file R wherein Thomas widow Molly applied for a pension based on his service Note on Baker DNA Study No proven descendant of Thomas Baker has yet taken the test however if his parentage is correct he should match those in the Thomas Baker group for that Thomas is grandfather to Thomas This Baker DNA group has four participants so far all of whom are from David Baker who would be an uncle of this younger Thomas They all match one another as they should One DNA match is a descendant of Adam Jackson Baker His parents are unproven but some think he is a son of Thomas DNA certainly supports that theory but doesn t prove it Thomas Baker was born per census analysis His widow stated that he was when he died in March If correct that puts his birth year at either or both of which match his census records I don t know where he was born exactly though certainly in Virginia probably Culpeper County Thomas Baker appears to be a son of William Baker and Anne Gambill of Culpeper and Botetourt Co VA I have not researched that family but I ve seen bits of evidence that seem to support this connection When Thomas was still young his father was killed by Indians Thomas was principally raised by his uncle Martin Gambill Thomas Baker served as a Private during the Revolutionary War under Capt William Nall and Capt Martin Gambill under Col Benjamin Cleveland and Gen Griffith Rutherford After the war Thomas Baker married Mary Molly Cantrell in Wilkes County Her maiden name and the date of marriage was given in her widow s pension application In her first deposition Dec she listed Mar In another deposition Aug she listed Mar and finally in she listed Sep I assume the last is most accurate She mentioned she had no record of the marriage nor was there a marriage bond for they married by publication banns They were married in Wilkes by William Nall Justice of the Peace Mary or Molly was born ca per her age of on the census In her deposition of Dec she was listed as years old which agrees with the census entry She stated she had no record of her age and that her husband was much older than she Actually he was only about or years older Thomas Baker was not listed on the State Census of North Carolina in Wilkes County Several other Bakers were listed in that county though which see The Bakers lived with Thomas uncle Martin Gambill for a few years right after they married per Pension files However they don t actually seem to be with them on the census Martin Gambill was listed on that census in Wilkes in Capt Nall s company William Nall who was listed next door to him and whose daughter Gambill had married Gambill s household contained one male aged to born between ca and ca That would be Gambill himself He also had two boys under born ca one of which could be Thomas Baker but it doesn t quite fit There was only one female in the house which was most likely Mrs Gambill Nancy Nall Morris Baker was just two houses away That suggests but doesn t prove a relationship between the two Baker families Thomas Baker is listed on the census in Wilkes County He was in the th Company There was one other Baker there though not listed nearby Ab Baker Abraham or Abram Baker Thomas uncle and foster father Martin Gambill was also in that district census analysis based on available evidence Explanation of this census Wilkes Co NC pg Thomas Baker Analysis Male s and Up before Thomas BAKER Male s under Son Female s any age before Mary Cantrell Baker wife I did not find Thomas Baker mentioned in Wilkes County N C Deed Books A B and C Martin Gambill was mentioned with land on Peach Bottom Mountain present day Alleghany County and Orr Knob I did not find Thomas Baker mentioned in Wilkes County N C Court Minutes Thomas Baker was named in Wilkes County court on Feb as the overseer of the road replacing Elijah Pennington The road description was not given From Wilkes County N C Court Minutes this was his only mention in that book In Ashe County was formed from the north western portion of Wilkes County including the area were Thomas Baker lived or else he moved into that area in the s It is possible that he lived near the border for he seemed to be back and forth in Wilkes and Ashe For the census Thomas Baker was listed in Ashe County along with several other Bakers which see Unfortunately this census was alphabetical so I can t tell who Thomas neighbors were nor where he was living For some reason Thomas household contained adult males I don t know who these were whether relatives or just boarders His wife s age is way off here but that is a typical census problem There seem to be other problems with this listing as well as he had children in who should have been listed back in but weren t census analysis based on available evidence Explanation of this census Ashe Co NC pg Thomas Baker Analysis Male s Thomas BAKER Brother gt gone by Brother gt gone by Brother

Zechariah Baker and James Baker these last two were also on South Fork Thomas Baker was listed on the census in Ashe Co NC There were quite a few Baker families in Ashe County NC which see Unfortunately the Ashe County census was alphabetical so we can t determine where anyone lived nor who their neighbors were census analysis based on available evidence Explanation of this census Ashe

determine more or less where each person lived and who their neighbors were James Baker was five houses away Hiram Baker was three houses away census analysis based on available evidence Explanation of this census Ashe Co NC pg Thomas Baker Analysis Male s Thomas BAKER Male s Son Male s Son Female s Mary Cantrell Baker wife Female s Daughter Female s Daughter Thomas Baker died either on Mar or Mar both dates given in Mary s Pension Affidavits in Ashe Co NC The last affidavit gave Mar as the date so it was probably more accurate I was unable to find widow Mary Cantrell Baker on the census She was not a head of household nor did any of the Baker households which see have a female her age residing with them She was probably with a married daughter that year For the census widow Mary was living in Ashe County with the James and Jane Ready or Reedy family One would assume that Jane was Mary s daughter or granddaughter The only Baker nearby was Adam Jackson Baker c who was ten households away Others list him as her son but I ve seen no proof yet other than proximity census abstract Explanation of this census Note The dates at the end of each line are not part of the original census but are approximate birth years based on age ASHE CO NC Page B House Family READY JAMES M W FARMER NC READY JANE F W NC READY WILLIAM M W NC READY ELIZABETH F W NC BAKER MARY F W NC In the s through widow Molly Baker made several affidavits to get a Pension based on her late husband s Revolutionary War service These are recorded in Pension File R Mrs Nancy Gambill aged widow of Martin Gambill also made a statement on her behalf in I didn t find Mary Molly Cantrell Baker on the census She probably died before then Children of Thomas Baker and Mary Cantrell Thomas Baker had lots of children per the through census records I have not identified any of them yet though I suspect that Hiram Baker c is his son but have no solid proof In the Pension files it is mentioned the first two children a boy and a girl died young but that they raised a large family Unfortunately none of them were named In Mary s last affidavit in a Mr John W Baldwin and a Mary Baker were witnesses One would assume they were related but I don t know how Widow Mary Cantrell Baker was living with James and Jane Ready in Jane was born ca per that census and close to that per This doesn t match any of Thomas and Mary s children per the census records This suggests that Mary could be a granddaughter or perhaps not even related I m listing Jane as a grandchild of Thomas and Mary for now just so I don t lose track of her Unknown Son Unknown Daughter Unknown Son Unknown Daughter Unknown Daughter Unknown Daughter Unknown Daughter Unknown Son Unknown Daughter Unknown Daughter Unknown Son Unknown Son Unknown Daughter Unknown Daughter Unknown Son Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age He was home with him in aged under born ca and still home in aged born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was not home with him in or but was home in aged born ca This absence from the earlier records may indicate that this isn t a daughter at all but someone else who was just living with him in She was no longer with him by Unknown Son Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age He was home in aged under born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was not home in but was with him in aged born ca and gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was not home in but was with him in aged born ca and gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was not home in but was with him in aged born ca and still home in aged born ca and still home in aged born ca Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was home in aged under born ca and still home in age born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Son Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age He was home with him in aged under born ca and still home in aged born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then I strongly suspect that this unknown son is Hiram Baker c My proof is all circumstantial Hiram was near Thomas on the census Hiram named his oldest son Thomas Thomas did have an unidentified son this age per census analysis One flaw with the above is in DNA test results A descendant of Hiram Baker has taken the DNA test and his results do not match those in the Thomas Baker group If Hiram was a son of Thomas his male Baker descendants should have nearly identical Y Chromosome DNA results In fact as of this writing the Hiram Baker DNA results match no one else in the Baker DNA study DNA test results seem to remove Thomas from being a candidate for Hiram s father However with just one test result we can t rule it out completely There are always anomalies If a second proven descendant of Hiram from a different branch of his family were to take the test and his results matched the others then that would prove there is probably no anomaly See Hiram s page for more on him Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was home with him in aged under born ca and still home in aged born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was home with him in aged under born ca and still home in aged born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Son Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age He was home with him in aged under born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Son Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age He was home with him in aged under born ca and still home in aged born ca This could be Adam Jackson Baker c I have no direct evidence linking them but Jackson Baker was very close to widow Mary Cantrell Baker on the census in fact the only Baker listed even remotely close to her He does fit age wise I have nothing else that connects them though See his own page for more on him A descendant of Adam Jackson Baker has taken the DNA test and his results match those in the Thomas Baker group This means he certainly could be a son of Thomas Baker It doesn t prove they are father and son but it certainly proves they are related Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was home with him in aged under born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was home with him in aged under born ca and still home in aged born ca Researcher List Persons researching this family click here for data on how to get on or off of this list None so far
