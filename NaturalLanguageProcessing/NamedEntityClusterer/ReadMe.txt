Toolkits : Mallet,WEKA.

- It is relatively common for different people or organizations to share the same name. Given the increasing amount of information available online, this results in the ever growing possibility of finding misleading or incorrect information due to confusion caused by an ambiguous name.

- This system makes use of an unsupervised approach that resolves name ambiguity by clustering the instances of a given name into groups, each of which is associated with a distinct underlying entity.
