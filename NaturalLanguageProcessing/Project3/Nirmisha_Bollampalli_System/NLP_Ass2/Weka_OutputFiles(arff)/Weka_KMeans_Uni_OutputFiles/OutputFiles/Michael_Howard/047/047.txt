MICHAEL HOWARD CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT GENERAL ELECTION VOTES TAX TAXATION RATES AND COUNCIL TAX MICHAEL HOWARD CONSERVATIVE MP HOME CUISINE ENVIRONMENT INSURANCE HORSES LEGENDS LAW NEWS PRODUCE RIGHTS SITE INDEX TRANSPORT WHISTLEBLOWING Michael Howard launches Conservative Election C aign Michael Howard has launched the party s general election c aign with a rousing rallycall to the country to abandon the failed policies of Tony Blair s Labour Party and turn to the Conservatives to give the nation a fresh start But has he said anything about tackling council corruption Not as far as we know Should he not be promising voters that he will put a halt to the extraordinary waste of ratepayers money brought on by corrupt planning officers We estimate this waste to be in the order of million per council That adds up to a tidy sum Enough to bail out just about every other shortage in public funding Michael Howard MP Why do you think politicians need to resort to stealth taxes Take Road Tax This tax was introduced to pay for road building yet only about actually goes to build roads The rest is diverted to support other high spend areas such as protecting crooked planning officers We need honest taxes for honest purposes We need an efficient government and an efficient local government We do not need dishonest local officials milking the system for their own purposes Building empires We need affordable housing decent schools and sensibly priced services At the moment council tax is crippling most folk Not to mention the fact is is a grossly unfair tax aimed only at people who are sitting targets Can the Conservatives under Michael Howard deliver the above We doubt it The Conservatives have not tackled white collar crime at local council level before true they commissioned Lord Nolan to look into the situation But as soon as the awful truth emerged via a recommendation for new criminal statute to tackle malicious use of public funds and personal vendettas they hastily put the brakes on Cowards Nelson Kruschandl says It s Time for Change Neither the Conservatives or New Labour have tackled white collar crime at local council level Both of these parties allow local council s to run riot with your money allow council officers to deceive councillors and torture the public by refusing to answer reasonable questions the threatening citizens with legal action where these same planning officers know developments are permitted and is some cases harassing members of the public to bankruptcy at huge expense to the ratepayer See Staffordshire County Council and Brian Goodacre as prime ex les The major political parties are simply Chicken Then as soon as the Human Rights Act looked set to give the common man a chance they changed the rules regarding Legal Aid funding making it almost impossible to obtain representation and justice Speaking before the Prime Minister travelled from Downing Street to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen to dissolve Parliament Mr Howard put his party on the front foot with a promise to do the best for Britain with an action programme that would reward the hardworking law abiding majority while delivering improved school discipline cleaner hospitals more police on the streets and controlled immigration Kicking off the party c aign in the courtyard of a central London hotel he declared The choice before the voters on May is very clear they can either reward Mr Blair for eight years of broken promises and vote for another five years of talk or they can vote Conservative to support a party that s taken a stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hard working Britons Insisting that the Labour government has lost the plot Mr Howard accused Tony Blair of taking honest hardworking people for granted and failing to recognise how worried NHS patients are about hospital infections how pensions are fearful of rising crime and how parents fear that their children cannot learn in class because of the lack of proper school discipline Denouncing the way Labour has frittered away huge tax incomes with little improvement in public services Mr Howard offered a better way which would help those who do the right thing and play by the rules He said the Conservative timetable for action would build a brighter better future for the country with more value for money and lower taxes with discipline restored to schools with hospital matrons given the power to close wards infected with MRSA with reduced crime and an extra more police officers on the streets each year backed by tougher sentences for burglars and drug dealers and controlled immigration with an annual limit on the number of people who can settle in Britain He declared Some people say I shouldn t talk about difficult issues like the abuse of our asylum system and those travellers who stick two fingers up to the law But we cannot make Britain a better place if we sweep difficult issues under the carpet Everyone knows you won t fix a problem if you aren t even prepared to discuss it Mr Howard said he was not prepared to appease special interest groups and wanted all Britons to play by the same rules Buoyed up by improving opinion poll surveys and a party brimming with confidence and enthusiasm Mr Howard said that while the Prime Minister was already secretly grinning about the prospect of his third victory there was no reason why the country had to deliver Labour a third term in Downing Street And in a clear message to the electorate he embarked on a vigorous four week nationwide c aign declaring If you re thinking what we re thinking it s time for urgent action on the things that really matter reward for hardworking Britons school discipline cleaner hospitals more police and controlled immigration So I say again the choice before voters on May the fifth is very clear They can either reward Mr Blair for eight years of broken promises and vote for another five years of talk Or they can vote Conservative to support a party that s taken a stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hard working Britons Michael and Sandra Howard The issues that matter to hard working Britons Speech launching election c aign in the South in Winchester The choice before voters on May the fifth is very clear They can either reward Mr Blair for eight years of broken promises and vote for another five years of talk Or they can vote Conservative to support a party that s taken a stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hard working Britons Conservatives will restore discipline in our classrooms by giving head teachers control over their schools We will clean up our hospitals by giving matrons the power to close wards that are infected with MRSA We will cut crime by each year putting more police officers real police officers on our streets and introducing tougher sentences for burglars and drug dealers We will reduce immigration by setting an annual limit on the number of people who can come and settle in Britain And we will reward hardworking Britons by giving them value for money and lower taxes People work hard for their money and they deserve to keep more of it Mr Blair promised that he had no plans to increase tax at all But he has put taxes up times mostly by stealth And it s hurting According to the independent Institute for fiscal studies average incomes have started to fall for the first time in ten years It s not the rich getting soaked It is normal hard working families trying to make ends meet And if Mr Blair gets in again taxes will go up again Rarely in the history of politics has a government spent so much taxed so much and achieved so little People work hard they pay their taxes and they deserve value for their money But today families are paying an average of in extra tax a year and what have they got to show for it Everyone knows there is no such thing as a free lunch With Mr Blair you pay for lunch and it never seems to turn up Britain cannot carry on indefinitely spending more than it is earning without higher taxes or higher interest rates If we are to secure our future economic prosperity government must once again start to live within its means There are two Britains today private sector Britain where people are working harder just to stand still struggling just to make ends meet And bureaucratic Britain where money is no object you spend what you like you employ who you like For every job the private sector lost last year the public sector took on almost two more Britain cannot carry on like this without storing up huge problems for the future You know a country is living on borrowed time when government is the fastest growing industry in town So we have a plan to get a grip on government spending That s why a Conservative government will cut waste There ll be per cent fewer MPs and per cent fewer government ministers Over quangos will disappear bureaucratic posts will go We ll scrap the New Deal There ll be no new Supreme Court And as for those unelected unaccountable regional assemblies the playthings of John Prescott we ll get rid of them too Yes these decisions are tough but they are right Right because they ll get resources to the front line to our schools and hospitals giving taxpayers value for their money Right because they ll help pay of debt and avoid Mr Blair s tax rises And right because they ll enable a Conservative to lower taxes Do you really believe this man I believe that families are better at spending their hard earned cash than any politician That is why Conservatives will cut taxes The hardest hit by Labour s stealth taxes have been the older generation If you want to know about a family look at how they treat their older relatives And if you want to know about a country look at how it cares for its older generation How a country treats the older generation is a test of its values Many served our country in her greatest hour of need fighting for liberty freedom and Britain s independence for future generations We must never forget the contribution they have made and continue to make to our communities But in Britain today too many pensioners are not shown the respect they deserve or given the dignity that is their due The older generation don t seem to feature in Mr Blair s New Britain New Labour s Britain is a country where the older generation has been airbrushed out As Frank Field Mr Blair s own former social security minister has said Labour took one of the best pensions systems in Europe and turned into one of the worst People who saved for their retirement suddenly found that the money they d put aside simply wasn t there that the value of their pensions had been destroyed by Mr Blair s stealth taxes And Labour have forced nearly half all pensioners are onto means testing Pensioners quite rightly resent means testing It is at total odds with the values of the forgotten majority the people who work hard who take responsibility for themselves and save for their retirement Means testing is wrong It penalises people for doing the right thing saving for their retirement It sends a clear signal to the younger generation Don t bother to save Spend whatever you can before you retire because your future is one of dependency on the State Means testing is humiliating forcing pensioners to go cap in hand to the State for what they are due And means testing is complicated That s why over one and a half million eligible pensioners don t even claim what they are owed I want our country to honour our senior citizens cherish their wisdom and care for their needs a country where they can live in security and with dignity respected and protected To those who have given so much we must surely give what is their due I will increase the basic state pension in line with earnings making pensioners up to a week better off after four years By increasing the basic pension we will free hundreds of thousands pensioners from the tyranny of means tested benefits restoring their dignity independence and self respect I will give every home where the adults are sixty five and over a fifty per cent Council Tax discount up to a maximum of This will ensure that Council Tax bills for five million pensioners are cut Taken together these proposals will mean that pensioner households will be up to a year better off it s a thousand pounds And I will stop the disgrace of elderly people being forced to sell their homes saying goodbye forever to their independence to pay for their residential care Smile and wave goodbye to you taxes It s important that government rewards people who work hard and have contributed to our society And it s important too that government upholds the law Some people say I shouldn t talk about difficult issues like the abuse of our asylum system and those travellers who stick two fingers up to the law But we cannot make Britain a better place if we sweep difficult issues under the carpet Everyone knows you won t fix a problem if you aren t even prepared to discuss it I m not prepared to appease special interest groups because I believe passionately in fair play We are all British and we should all have to play by the same rules Nor will I be distracted from doing what I believe is best for Britain by the smirking politics of Mr Blair or the woolly thinking of the Liberal Democrats So on each of these issues on rewarding those who work hard and have contributed to our country on schools on hospitals on crime and on immigration we have a detailed published Timetable for Action so you can hold us to account Look for this commitment in your paper check it on the net put it up on your fridge door hold me to it And beware yet another election where Mr Blair says one thing to get your vote on polling day and does something quite different afterwards Mr Blair is already secretly grinning about the prospect of his third victory Imagine five more years of him Well you don t have to settle for it If you re thinking what we re thinking it s time for urgent action on the things that really matter Reward for hardworking Britons School discipline Cleaner hospitals More police and Controlled immigration So I say again the choice before voters on May the fifth is very clear They can either reward Mr Blair for eight years of broken promises and vote for another five years of talk Or they can vote Conservative to support a party that s taken a stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hard working Britons CONSERVATIVE PARTY LINKS Newsroom News headlines Speeches Multimedia Blogs Recent press releases Articles Local Govt Results News archive MEP news Media Centre News
