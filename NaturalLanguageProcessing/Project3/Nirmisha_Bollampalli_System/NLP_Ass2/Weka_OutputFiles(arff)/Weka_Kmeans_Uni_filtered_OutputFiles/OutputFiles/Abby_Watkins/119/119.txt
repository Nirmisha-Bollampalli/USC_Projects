STEVE SHIPOOPY SCHNEIDER Speed Freak Interview with Steve Shipoopy Schneider May Melbourne Australia The first time I saw Steve Schnider was in a climbing video He was explaining the ins and outs of competition climbing on a tiny wall in what appeared to be someone s backyard I remembered this espically because I wondered at the time Who is this guy and why the hell have they let him on this video His little skit was very funny but he seemed to be too much of a clown I wondered why they hadn t picked a serious climber for the role This I was to find out was my first introduction to what seems to be Steve Shipoopy Schnieder s motto seriously but never seriously It was later that I found out that Shipoopy the name Steve Schneider sounds too serious for this guy wasn t just the court jester he was also a very serious climber The clown I saw in the video was a certified UIAA course setter At this stage he has climbed over routes graded climbed El Cap times he is at the cutting edge setting new records of speed and endurance He s definately more than a clown Australia holds a very special place for Shipoopy as he owes his initial break throughs to Australian influences He climbed in Europe under the tutorlege of Kim Carrigan Carrigan who was one of the top climbers at that stage took him under his wing to train as a prodigere This had a strong influence on Shipoopy as it was competing with Carrigan that he realised his potential He laughs as he explains how Carrigan would get a little tweaked when his supremecy was challenged by this unknown American upstart Sometime later Shpoopy spent three months climbing in Australia Here again he was influenced by Australia Under the influence of the locals he abandoned his purist ethics and starting hangdoging The results amazed him and showed up pretty soon He climbed his first three s at Arapps Ogiver Slinking Leopard and India He has climbed over since Shpoopy has now made a name for himself speed climbing in the Yosemite Valley Along with the likes of Hans Florine Peter Croft and Dave Schultz he has helped push speed and endurance records to amazing levels At one point he set the speed record for the Nose hrs minutes He has set endurance records by climbing three grade VI big wall climbs in one day pushes all in one week West Butteress VI A Chinese Water Torture VI A and Dihedral Wall VI A All these climbs were done in fastest times to date This feat remains unrepeated With Hans Florine he climbed three El Cap routes in a day Nose VI A Lurking Fear VI A and West Face VI b His climb Circus Circus reputed to be the most sustained climb in America when it was put up in still awaits a second ascent This foot route has successive pitches of c a c c a a It took days to put up and he red pointed the route without taking any falls He s definately the unchallenged clown at his circus I caught up with him on his second trip to Australia He was on a lecture tour but he still found time to climb tell bad blond jokes give instructional clinics and ofcourse laugh Shipoopy is a man who is as serious about having fun as he is about having more fun Have you done any climbing in Australia Ten years ago I was here I climbed in Australia for three months and in New Zealand for six weeks I had a great time I actually led my first here in Australia Which one was that Ogiver was my first and then I did India and Slinking Leopard That must have been a real break through for you It was a breakthrough I adopted the hangdog tactics of the locals I used to be very pure and not like hanging on the rope I started doing what the locals did and began to climb really hard I really liked it Do you plan to do any climbing this trip Oh yeah I climbed Ozymandieas Direct with Abby Watkins We got some good information and we broke the record first try by seconds Briefly could you tell me a bit about the history of speed climbing in the Yosemite valley It s a long proud history The forefathers Robins Roper those guys always took a watch along in the s and s and saw how fast they could go I spoke to Roper one of the pioneers in the s who wrote the first guide book and he felt that there was a bit of a competitive thing going on from the out set People would go up there with a watch and measure up their time If someone broke a record someone would get really pissed and shatter that one They would get this record war going on they are still going on Hans Florine would get his Nose record broken and would go back better it Then Peter Croft would beat it He figured the only way to keep it there would be to tie up with Peter Croft They set the record that s held on for years now and good luck to anyone who wants to beat that That s over how many feet of climbing Approximately feet That s absolutely flying If you wanted to divide by pitches you ll get their minutes per pitch That s pretty impressive too Is there any official way of measuring the time The way speed climbers are measured when the first person starts climbing that s when the clock gets started and it is stopped when the last climber and or the haul bag is pulled up over the edge When the guy s jumars hit the anchors that s when the clock stops Has speed climbing developed because of the intensity of the scene in the Yosemite valley I think it s just the competitive nature of man The thrill of victory and the drama of athetlic competition You see it in the Olympics and it just transfers over to climbing Partly because there are some really great climbers that have gathered in Yosemite and have got really good at doing these things Seeing that you have done so much speed climbing what do you think of the early speed ascents that were done in the early s by people like Royal Robins Especially without the modern gear like friends I think its phenomenal They were banging pitons Steve Roper did the first grade VI in America back in the Regular Route on the Half Dome He was gambling They didn t have head l s back in those days Basically if they got caught out by night they would have to shiver it out till the morning Steve says he remembers being there before first light of the day piton in his hand just waiting for it to be light enough so he could see where to put it He just charged it He probably put pitons in and out with his partner Jeff Foott that day Surely no one have had used that many pitons like that They just finished up in the light of the day I just find it phenomenal that they just had this amazing craft of using pitons fast not over driving them That art of using pitons like that is lost because we use friends in anything over a one inch crack In Steve Roper and Jeff Foott climbed the first grade VI in a one day ascent Why do you think it took nearly a decade for that feat to be repeated Well partly because the Half Dome is ft and the Nose is ft So it was another big step up No one actually thought he could do it Could you describe the reaction of the climbing community when the North American Wall was climbed in a day in October It was the route which was considered to be the hardest in the world when it was first climbed in There was alot of debate behind that Guys like Peter Croft said that those guys climbed it in Steve Gerbeding Scott Stowe and Rick Lovelace were that honest Peter Croft enraged those guys because he said you guys didn t do it Now we are going to go up and do it in a day To Gerbeding it didn t matter because they had done it single push It didn t matter if it was or The thing is that they had gone up without the haulbag and done it There were mixed reactions to that There was a claim to the first true one day ascent of the North American Wall when it was done by Hans Florin and party when they did it in hours something The thing is that wouldn t have done it that fast or felt that they could do it that fast unless Steve had done it before them Despite the mixed reaction it was a big milestone In the North American Wall was considered the hardest technical rock route in the world It was that route that brought a real notoriety to the Yosemite Valley To have that route be climbed in a single push was absolutely mind blowing to the first ascentist and alot of other people myself included Are you familiar with that route How many pitches is it Around ish Haven t climbed it yet Saving it for that one day onsight Laughs How does speed climbing differ from normal big wall climbing The main thing is you don t have a haul bag and you have to be willing to climb at night Not having the haul bag frees you from alot of extra work It also gives you the commitment that you have to get up the wall otherwise you are going to have a really uncomfortable night out You are committed to climb fast You ve done your ground work You ve done your grade IVs your grade Vs in a day You are ready to go fast You ve got less water Because you are committed to going fast and going at night You just do it Are there any major differences in technique It s not so much technique Alot of it is just beta How to do these routes faster When to combine pitches Basically its the same thing leaning cleaning hauling You just keep your ropes really neat Have a team of three working efficiently together as a team has been worked to a perfection in the last few years more than anything In one week you climbed three Grade VIs in one day pushes West Buttress Chinese Water Torture and the Dihedral Wall What were your thoughts at the end of that week What s the next step Can I do four in a week What s the next challenge My body went through alot It was a real test of my body Every once in a while I want to test it to see what it can do and really push it I was just amazed that I could go on like that It s seeing what I can do then learning from that and maybe adding on to it somehow It s a progressive thing Has anyone else done three Grade VIs in that short a stretch of time Well I did three El Cap routes in a day But they weren t onsight routes so that was a different thing That particular trifecta hasn t been repeated How many times have you climbed El Cap times as of this conversation I hope to get to by the end of the year What s the attraction of climbing it that many times Oh its fun You can go up on a weekend and blast it in a speed climb You come down and you are absolutely hammering You go back to work Monday morning and you don t even care because your hands are just raw You have this huge smile across your face when you do the Captain Its absolutely addicting totally phenomenal when you are up there and it s fun Better than a carnival ride times ten What was the initial reaction to John Bachar and Peter Croft s one day ascent of the Nose on El Cap and the Regular Route on the Half Dome I think there wasn t too much surprise I think people realised that it could be done I had done two El Cap routes in a day So it was just a natural progression that someone did People who didn t know what had gone on before might have been surprised but really it was one of the next steps in things to do Could you tell me a bit about your climb Circus Circus It was reputed to be the hardest sustained route in America It has successive pitches of c a c c a a Does it still hold that reputation No Salathe the Nose the Direct Route all free on the Half Dome are all harder It was up there in It was one of the hardest for sure Top three long hard routes There were very few routes that were that long that had multiple pitches of on them Atleast that I know about It was just a personally satisfying thing to do I wasn t out there to put up the hardest single free climb I was just drawn to this amazing line that I could see from the road I just had to do it Fate and destiny kind of control my life in these things There are just some things that I had to do I was so amazing that that climb was even possible when you look at it from the ground It looks desperately thin and it looks like it isn t going to go and it does barely Still awaits a second ascent Speed climbing is obviously extremely intense Things like the Peter Croft and Dave Schultz duo climbing pitches in a day sounds absolutely incredible Those guys are a phenomenal team But even they had limits They tried to do a quadvecta They did Higher Cathedral Rock by Mary s Tears climbed the Rostrum climbed the West Face of El Cap went to do Astroman and they were getting tired Peter remembers getting to the top of the second pitch and Dave s hanging off a quarter inch bolt with a bomber friend crack right next to him Peter couldn t for the life of him explain to him that he should have backed up the anchor He was like Huuuuh whaaat They realised that they d better get down They ve been pushing it too hard They couldn t tell the difference between a hallucination from a bolt But its rad they tried it Those two formed one of the best speed climbing teams ever Their Rostrum time is like They just free soloed this thing They simol climbed this thing and they were fast When I did it with Wally it took hours That s four or five times as long The times involved are incredible enough and then they get bettered constantly You soloed the nose in hours something and then Hans Florine comes along and does it in hours I did the Nose in and Hans climbed it in He really shattered that record To top that that was his first rope solo ever How does the climbing differ style at Toulomie Meadows differ from Yosemite Yosemite valley is characteristic of very parallel cracks that lack alot of face holds These force pretty hard difficult finger wrenching toe binding climbing maneuvers Toulomie has all these protuberances or knobs and face edges You can climb vertical faces much more naturally there than in the Yosemite valley For me it developed a technique of being very technical on dead vertical faces with my feet Being able to stay on really tiny edges really came to be an art form in Toulomie You see alot of climbers who climb at Toulomie John Bachar Kurt Smith and Ed Barry in competitions their foot work does them wonders In your article Sea of Domes you describe the tension the ethical wars has created there The clash of ethics between ground up climbers like John Bachar and rap bolters such as Ron Kauk Oh yeah I don t think Ron s ever forgiven me for that article Its never been the same between us but I just told it like it is When you do something as public as chopping someone else s route I think you have to live up to it If you aren t ready to do that maybe you shouldn t do it in the first place I chopped bolts once and it was a big mistake I was sorry the next day I was drunk when I did it I learnt my lesson I ll never chop bolts again There was a big issue of ethics when Toulomie was started to get repelled placed bolts I wanted to keep it a traditional area to do routes from the bottom to the top What was going to happen was that these routes were going to be done quicker than I could have done then in the traditional way The rock would get used up because it is so limited It came to a point where I had to make a choice weather to keep my friends or my ethics I chose my friends I chose to accept rap bolting rather than fight against it and make a bunch of enemies So rap bolting is becoming very popular there Yeah it s done all the time I never do it though because I still love that adventure of not knowing if a routes going to go I wouldn t ask anybody else to put routes from the ground up I don t push any kind of ethics on any other people You want to set the bolts in the right place sport climbing is an easier way of doing it I manage to put the bolts in the right place by spending years doing it and being smart about it ground up style But I think everybody has to just do what s right for them I will respect them for that Do you ever think the Toulomie testpiece Bachar Yerian will ever be rap bolted It might be possible but they would get chopped I would chop them if someone did that That would be a blight to everyone who has gone up there and gotten the guts to do that route That would be shitting on them It would be bringing it down from another level You can fall from almost anywhere on the route and you won t die you ll get hurt So its not like you are looking at a death fall You have to really build yourself into this spiritual mind awareness plane of really keeping your mind in control in the face of a big fall It s been one of the best experiences People have come from all over the world to do that route So anyone who would put bolts into that I can tell you would be slandered for life At the end of your article you sign off as a wanna be alpinist Have you done any alpine climbing I climbed Denali a few years ago I went to Patagonia and looking to go to California and do some peaks there I want to get into it I would like to go to the Himalaya and do some really high peaks Would you be interested in doing something like what Wolfgang Gullich did in the Trango Towers Free climbing up that high I would like to do those sort of things but I don t know who practical it is to really free climb there To free climb in the mountains takes a long time You are not going fast and speed is safety in alot of the mountains Don t get me wrong I would love to go up to the Trango Towers and free climb the Eternal Flame that Wolfgang and Kurt did in Phenomenal route but in a way its not that practical you ve gut to have decide whether a certain section might take you two days to do My whole speed climbing background has given me this attitude of just getting to the top getting down and then getting on something else More summits I want to do more Quantity not quality I want to do it all Do you have any big projects planned in the near future I ve been injured for nine months since my honeymoon It s a tendon thing a honeymoon injury I have no big projects planned except getting healthy I plan to do some walls because that doesn t hammer my wrist as much as extreme free climbing I dream of getting back to really hard climbing back up to the level of but I keep getting injured left and right In the last three years I ve broken three ribs kayaking broken my leg in two places climbing last year and three months later I injured my tendon wind surfing I m just having a hard time staying healthy right now MAIL ME HOME PAGE
