husband at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Bartlesville OK Our family has maintained memory of her line going back a few generations through Missouri to Kentucky but had little more than guesses past

some of it Note I still haven t seen Hyatt s Baker Book Most of the early part of what follows was taken from this work provided online by Kay Withers I have spent some time in the VA State library

making the journey by train They set up a church for the neighbors though it never grew probably in part because Alphonso refused to allow musical instruments During the early s they moved to Fort Scott where Alphonso served as Chief of Police According to his grandson Walter Alphonso Varvel the town lost a bit of fine revenue during this time since instead of locking up the town drunks he had the habit of taking them home and sobering them up Walter also recalled that he was a kindly heavy man whom he liked very much and referred to as Pops Baker He was also bald and colorblind Alphonso

business college though before she finished she went to work for the Missouri Pacific Railroad in Ft Scott as a secretary to the foreman the first woman they had employed It was there she met Walter Andrew Varvel who was working fitting steam pipes Walter and May were married in and they lived in a house on Lowman St a narrow two story house with a garden out back and the necessary small building in the western part of Ft Scott In they decided to leave Ft Scott and get a farm in part because Walter thought the fumes at work he often worked hours shifts for about cents a day were causing him headaches and was part of a work strike that was never settled He sold the acre farm that he had grown up on and bought an acre one miles SE of Ft Scott where the family remained until when they moved near Bartlesville OK to be nearer to their daughter Frances Children of Walter Varvel and Elizabeth May Baker Walter Alphonso Frances Elizabeth Charles Wilson
