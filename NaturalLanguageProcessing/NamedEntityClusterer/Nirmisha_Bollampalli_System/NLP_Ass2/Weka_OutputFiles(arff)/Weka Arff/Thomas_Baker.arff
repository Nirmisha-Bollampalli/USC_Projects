Apr PM Instead of simply giving rock fans more of the same Roy Thomas Baker has managed throughout his long and distinguished career to produce audacious and distinctive projects while successfully reading the pulse of the mainstream rock audience His credits include a staggering number of bona fide superstars including Queen The Cars Foreigner Journey David Bowie Cheap Trick Ozzy Osbourne the Rolling Stones Free Alice Cooper Devo Santana Ten Years After T Rex The Who Yes and Frank Zappa Many other less vaunted artists have benefited from his creative touch too He got his start at Decca Records in England at the age of and later at Trident Studios where he was fortunate enough to work under such producers as Gus Dudgeon Peter Sullivan Tony Visconti and Ken Scott RTB became one of the founders of Trident s in house production company Neptune where he signed Queen and other acts During the last half of the s RTB relocated to Los Angeles and scored huge successes with Journey Foreigner and The Cars among others By the mid s he d become a senior VP of A R for Elektra during his tenure there the label signed Maniacs Simply Red Yello Peter Schilling and Metallica But late s American rock and pop held little interest for him so he found himself spending most of his time back in Europe where he produced a number of commercially successful and critically acclaimed releases including discs by The Stranglers Chris De Burgh and T Pau whose chart topping album and singles remained on the European charts for over a year T Pau s Heart and Soul was a Top Five hit in the U S as well Today Roy Thomas Baker spends most of his time in the U S While keeping Los Angeles his home base he has built a beautiful studio complex of his own complete with tennis court and olympic swim spa His elegant facility is a three and a half hour drive from L A in the foothills of the Mojave mountains above the shores of Lake Havasu His fabulously appointed and well equipped studio contains hard wired TLA Summit and Neve mixers a rare Stephens track fine tuned and maintained by John Stephens with Dolby SR and six Tascam DA s Fans of his work will want to look for upcoming releases by Local H Other Star People and Caroline s Spine Much of your production work draws from the best of American and British popular music idioms What music helped form your tastes growing up and what elements of that have carried over into your work The thing that I loved was the way American blues went over to England and got bastardized with artists like Clapton and the Stones and then went back to America It was this continual bouncing back and forth between the two places that all started off with Southern blues players One of my main inspirations was black music It didn t matter whether it was Tamla Motown or Stax or the early blues which I loved In fact I didn t know that the early blues existed until I heard the Stones and Clapton as a kid I suddenly realized These guys are great Where did they get it from That s how I learned about it I also loved American pop I loved the stuff that was being done by Bob Crewe and Phil Spector When I think of the Four Seasons The Ronettes and the Beach Boys wafting away with their four and five part harmony vocals those kinds of great vocals were not coming out of England at the time except in opera One common element found on many of your records is huge thick harmony vocal parts Now I can see the connection with the Beach Boys and the Four Seasons Oh yeah You can hear what was inspiring me as a producer to inspire bands I was working on to do that or connecting me with the bands that were good at doing that With The Cars you had this band with a sparse rhythm section and a unique singer in Ric Ocasek but when the harmonies kicked in it was a wall of sound They came at a time when rock radio really needed some freshening up I was going through my own little demons at the time I had been doing Queen which was kitchen sink over production which I loved But in the same way that we had the alterna music thing in the early s the end of the s had the punk era I would run into the Sex Pistols because they were working over at Wessex They were saying the usual All you bands are going to be gone because you re over produced and you re all fags and all that Laughs It was really funny I thought Maybe there is a point where I should be a bit more sparse So when I did the first Cars record we purposely did it very sparse but when the harmony vocals come in there are as many vocals there as there were in a Queen record The only difference is it was in and then it was gone Good Times Roll is a classic one for that When they sing those words it s huge and then it s gone and everything is back to sparse again I was able to put big vocals on a sparse punkish background sort of inventing post punk pop With Other Star People which I recently finished we re inventing post alterna pop Laughs I remember when the first Cars record hit Number One on the charts I was driving on Sunset Boulevard with Ric Ocasek We drove past a billboard for the Cars record and he said If someone had told me a year ago that I would be driving along Sunset Boulevard with Roy Thomas Baker looking up at a billboard of my record that is Number One I wouldn t have believed him On T Pau s Heart and Soul your approach to the rap portions of the song was unique We did Heart and Soul and there was this rap vocal for the first verse total rap Instead of just going out to a mic and just talking I did tracks of talking vocal for one speaker tracks for the other speaker for the middle and then tracks that were put out of phase to wrap around you and that was just for the rap section before any singing started It was scary and was hard work and it took a couple of days to do it I remember Carol Decker the singer walking out of the studio bursting into tears and saying to my wife Tere I hate your f ing husband but when the record hit the charts everywhere it was all fun Laughs So even when I did a straight rap record it wouldn t be someone merely rapping into a mic it would have to be something totally unusual and different With Queen the whole idea of big vocals were taken to outrageous operatic levels Bohemian Rhapsody was totally insane but we enjoyed every minute of it It was basically a joke but a successful joke Laughs We had to record it in three separate units We did the whole beginning bit then the whole middle bit and then the whole end It was complete madness The middle part started off being just a couple of seconds but Freddie kept coming in with more Galileos and we kept on adding to the opera section and it just got bigger and bigger We never stopped laughing That was at a time when rock bands were so intent on being heavy This was not exactly a cool idea It was very left of center Exactly It started off as a ballad but the end was heavy For the technical people who may want to know the end of the song was much heavier because it was one of the first mixes to be done with automation What happened was we had VCAs built into a Trident board over at Sarm Studios in London They put it in with the old Allison computer If you really listen to it the ballad starts off clean and as the opera section gets louder and louder the vocals get more and more distorted You can still hear this on the CD They are clearly distorted When we got to the end section the part in Wayne s World where they start doing this he bobs his head up and down there was no headroom on the VCAs yet there was loads of headroom on the Trident mixer So we got them to disconnect the computer and literally take all of the VCAs out of the faders and give us a direct feed for the faders to the mixer And we mixed the whole of the end section by hand The way we used to mix Queen was very odd and it evolved over time We had a big Trident board in the control room and every one of the guys would have to look after their own little parts They were turning on tom toms and riding bass runs and Brian May was turning on and off all of his guitar parts Then we would take all of the outputs from the Trident down to a separate mixer and I would control all of the drum fills and bass fills and do all of the stuff that I m good at So they would be looking after their little bits and I would actually be using their fingers as automation Then I basically had the main mix in front of me It wasn t done on computers It was done live The main feed from my mixer was going to the track So that was the way we would mix a record Killer Queen was done that way All the phasing parts weren t done in the mix they were done live For ex le the part about the laser beam was printed to tape with the effects during recording If you listen to the multitrack all the effects are on the tape The only thing different is the end of Killer Queen is actually real tape phasing That was a post production decision So do you typically print effects to tape when you record I m not one of these Oh we ll cut this and leave the effect for the mix I actually record the effects There is the artistic reason People play differently when they hear the effect and are playing to it Secondly it makes it so much easier to mix because the effects are already there You ve got to make these decisions up front Except for just basic echo I tend to also use the effects as we go when we record vocals For the really effected vocals on the new Local H record we did the effects live with the performance We had already visualized what we needed so we did that as we went along When Scott the singer sang with the effect in his headphones he could work with it and make the effect work a million times better I always visualize the overall sound of the album at the beginning You voice the parts and arrange the instrumentation that you use right at the very beginning With Local H we knew the running order of the album before we even started recording so we could work out our segues We had the plans on how one song would go into another and make the whole album a non stopping entity We even recorded everything in the running order so we could actually edit together the tracks from the track Stephens so they were flowing together before we even did any overdubs I never just leave it up to the mix and just hope One characteristic found on many of your records is the artful segue I love segues because I like records to be continuous and it gives me a good excuse not to turn off the music and put on something else Sometimes the record company initially didn t like them not for artistic reasons but because they thought that disc jockeys would have a problem taking the record off at that point So an alternative copy for radio with these big five second spacings between each song would be made as in the case of Journey s Infinity What made it funnier was disc jockeys played the segues even more on that album They played the first three or four songs of The Cars first album together too Laughs Even now they are still playing the segues Your records have always sounded like they were practically exploding out of the radio What things did you do to help ensure that effect As long as you know up front that a certain song is destined for radio and MTV you should come at it straight out of the gate from the beginning in pre production We make sure that the sound is together from day one The whole idea is to make you sound louder so that it jumps out in your face The trick to this has to do with creating apparent volume as opposed to actual volume See the radio station s compressors will react to actual volume and turn the music down That s why some people s mixes will actually sound quieter than the song previous and the song being played after When we first record we re always saturating We have all the machines lined up in such a way that we have everything hitting the end stops I run everything in the red all of the time I don t look at meters We run the consoles in the red especially the tube ones like the Summit and TLA tube mixers and the Neve We run the machines in the red right down to the tape We check back to the tape to make sure that we re not over saturating From what I understand you ve startled more than a few proper engineers with your methodology Oh yeah All the time I just whack those faders up That s what I do Especially when I m mixing the drum rides I would whack them up so loud that they would saturate the mixing board and then they would saturate the tape machine Obviously after a certain level they don t get any louder on tape It gets louder when you re watching it but it doesn t get any louder on tape because it has reached its peak What happens is the bottom end fills out It is technically distortion but it is also bringing out those nice third and fifth harmonics that you want to hear Doing it this way adds a tremendous value to the bass end It makes it grind and pump out on the radio more It s apparent volume as opposed to actual volume Many artists seem to feel that they should produce themselves What are your thoughts on that Every artist would like to produce their own records That to me is a bit like someone wanting to be their own lawyer in court and even if you are a lawyer you shouldn t represent yourself in court I think even if you re a great producer who happens to be an artist and you re great at working with other artists you should never produce yourself You still need somebody else around to make sure you get the best out of yourself because you can t be in two places at once A lot of artists will go to an engineer who is probably a great engineer but as of that stage has not seriously produced anything They forget that there s more to a production than getting a nice polished sound People will not go out and buy a nice drum sound if the song isn t there When Ric Ocasek does his own records he doesn t always produce himself He lets other people produce him Yet Ric is a very good producer and has produced some hits himself like Weezer Was there a pivotal moment where a light went off and you thought I want to be a producer No I think I always wanted to be a producer from the age of or My opportunity came with my internship at Decca We called it apprenticeship over there you call it internship in America It s basically where you do all the dull work for hours for no pay Laughs And nothing has changed Nor should it change It s a great way to sort out the people who are really genuine and the people who are in it for a quick buck You can t make a quick buck in that route You have to work very hard and eventually if you are given that opportunity and you succeed at that opportunity then there are big bucks to be made It is hard work up to that point I think I was paid the equivalent of pounds a week no overtime nothing I subsidized my pay by being a race car mechanic which I actually thought was great fun anyway It gave me Saturdays making sure there were great fuel injectors on these race cars What would you say is a primary guiding philosophy behind your production work My whole thing is the more different you can sound from anything else around but still be commercially successful is great Over the years I ve always hearkened back to that philosophy Back when I did Bohemian Rhapsody who would ve ever thought of having a single with an opera section in the middle The first Cars record was totally unique Even projects I did when I was going from second engineer to engineer like T Rex s Get It On Bang A Gong or Free s All Right Now had a different twist on what was basically the same thing People need an identifiable sound When your song is being played on the radio people should hear who that is even without the DJ mentioning who it is That s true with all the great bands even ones that have been around for hundreds of years like the Stones Even though they have had a lot of different changes of sound you can hear who it is instantly That rule applies for every great band of the last years There are thousands and thousands of bands out there with these really smooth great generic sounding records that nobody gives a toss about Then somebody like Beck comes along and he hits a can and sings about being a loser and he gets a Number One and who knows what that was recorded on Laughs And who cares I loved it If you don t have that identifiable sound you are getting merged in If the DJ isn t mentioning who it is then nobody will know who it is It will just be another band and nothing is worse than being anonymous That is exactly what you don t want Want to use this article Click here for options Prism Business Media Inc

'MOH Citation for Thomas Baker The President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to BAKER THOMAS A Rank and organization Sergeant U S Army Company A th Infantry th Infantry Division Place and date Saipan Mariana Islands June to July Entered service at Troy N Y Birth Troy N Y G O No May Citation For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty at Saipan Mariana Islands June to July When his entire company was held up by fire from automatic weapons and small arms fire from strongly fortified enemy positions that commanded the view of the company Sgt then Pvt Baker voluntarily took a bazooka and dashed alone to within yards of the enemy Through heavy rifle and machinegun fire that was directed at him by the enemy he knocked out the strong point enabling his company to assault the ridge Some days later while his company advanced across the open field flanked with obstructions and places of concealment for the enemy Sgt Baker again voluntarily took up a position in the rear to protect the company against surprise attack and came upon heavily fortified enemy pockets manned by officers and enlisted men which had been bypassed Without regard for such superior numbers he unhesitatingly attacked and killed all of them Five hundred yards farther he discovered men of the enemy who had concealed themselves behind our lines and destroyed all of them On July the perimeter of which Sgt Baker was a part was attacked from sides by from to Japanese During the early stages of this attack Sgt Baker was seriously wounded but he insisted on remaining in the line and fired at the enemy at ranges sometimes as close as yards until his ammunition ran out Without ammunition and with his own weapon battered to uselessness from hand to hand combat he was carried about yards to the rear by a comrade who was then himself wounded At this point Sgt Baker refused to be moved any farther stating that he preferred to be left to die rather than risk the lives of any more of his friends A short time later at his request he was placed in a sitting position against a small tree Another comrade withdrawing offered assistance Sgt Baker refused insisting that he be left alone and be given a soldier s pistol with its remaining rounds of ammunition When last seen alive Sgt Baker was propped against a tree pistol in hand calmly facing the foe Later Sgt Baker s body was found in the same position gun empty with Japanese lying dead before him His deeds were in keeping

'Humphrey Baker Descendant Thomas Baker Home Descendants History Timeline Maps Pictures DNA Project Links Contact Us History of Thomas Baker Thomas Baker was born about location unknown and died September in Estill Co Kentucky Thomas made his will the day before he died listing children Jacob Baker the heirs of Joseph Baker Humphrey Baker William Baker the heirs of Thomas Baker Jr and daughters Betsy Nix Polly Bell Sally Hubbard and Caty Baker At this time it is unknown who the wife or wives of Thomas Baker were In Thomas moved to future Washington County Virginia with his parents where acres was surveyed for Humphrey on April on Stalnakers Creek today s Hutton Creek near the present town of Glade Spring The land which lay on both sides of the creek included the path over Walker Mountain to the North fork of the Holston and beyond and northwest of Stalnaker who had settled on Indian fields in This made Humphrey the western most settler at the time Stalnaker only had a lease to crop for his trading post settlement Historian J Allen Neal in his bicentennial history of Washington County Virginia incorrectly concluded that the Stalnaker settlement was west of that of Baker that Hutton Creek was Stalnaker s Creek and Baker s Creek was the stream that follows the Smyth Washington County line Actually Stalnaker s Creek Baker s Creek and the present day Hutton s Creek are one and the same depending on which period of history is being considered The survey from patents and deeds confirm it For many years after the Baker settlement was the farthest outpost of the frontier Thomas served as a member of the Bedford Co Virginia militia at the height of the first phase of the French and Indian War in He received pay in for his services as a soldier at Fort Fauquier on the James River as a member of Col John Buchanan s Company He was a member as was his father of Capt Alexander Sayer s Troop of Horse Company Thomas along with his father Humphrey and family

Kentucky Thomas is listed on the monument at Point Pleasant W V honoring the soldiers who participated in the Battle at Point Pleasant in Thomas is not listed in the tax list of Washington Co Virginia

'Thomas Baker How Bakersfield Got Its Name By Chris Brewer Colonel Thomas Baker senator assemblyman Colonel of the Iowa Territorial Militia Receiver for the United States Land Office developer lawyer surveyor statesman and entrepreneur These are some of the titles which Baker could lay claim to during his lifetime He was responsible for the settlement of many communities in both Iowa and California One such community bears his name Bakersfield California Baker was described as being a man of rather slender build about five feet ten or eleven inches in height and having a light complexion He is said to have been a fair scholar and to have had good business qualities He was born and raised in Ohio growing up there later moving to the Territory of Wisconsin which soon became Iowa Territory First relocating to Slaughter County in Baker was appointed as Clerk of the Court of the first District Court Later that year he was also appointed as the Clerk of the Board of County Commissioners A self taught attorney he was also appointed as the first United States District Attorney for Washington County holding that office until Iowa was admitted to the Union as a state in In Baker was nominated as a Colonel in the Iowa Territory Militia Baker served on the Fourth and Sixth Territorial Legislative Assemblies Continuing to be involved in State government Baker relocated to Polk County and later Des Moines Once Iowa gained statehood Baker was elected as a member of the first State Legislature as a repre sentative of a large district made up of Marion Polk Jasper and Dallas counties During his tenure in the Iowa legislature Baker drafted many laws in the state s first code He was elected President of the State Senate thus becoming ex officio Iowa s first Lieutenant Governor Political turmoil was the determining factor to send Baker packing for California in arriving in the fall landing first according to family lore in Benecia Baker soon moved inland to Stockton a port on the San Joaquin River By he proceeded southward to the delta land in the northern area of the newly formed Tulare County This area was rich in its forests of Oaks Sycamores and other indigenous trees Baker and his family were among the first four families to settle in the area which was later to become the city of Visalia in Tulare County Old timers and family alike credit Baker with laying out the town for Nathaniel Vice the credited founder of the town Baker s second wife died in the mid s and he not being much of a bachelor remarried at age His new bride Ellen Whalen was a young woman of twenty In Baker was elected to the State Assembly representing Fresno and Tulare counties serving in and Baker was also appointed Receiver for the United States Land Office by President James Buchanan serving during Buchanan s term In Baker was elected to represent Tulare and Fresno Counties in the State Senate serving in the sessions of Baker and his son James were taken to the Kern Island area in by Captain Elisha Stephens who led the first wagon trains over the Sierra Nevada In Baker was involved in a legislative act which created an opportunity to reclaim sw and overflow lands in the southern valley This act eventually known as the Montgomery Act offered the right to reclaim all the sw and overflow lands belonging to the state located between the San Joaquin River at Kings River Slough and Tulare Lake For this the contractors would be deeded a percentage of the recovered land This act would later become the basis of Baker s activities in the southern San Joaquin Valley Though not the original contractor Baker and a partner purchased the rights to the contract and Baker moved onto Kern Island purchasing Christian Bohna s property in Though normally a sw y area in the southern San Joaquin Valley was suffering from the worst drought since the state was settled by Americans Baker was able to construct a dam across the outlet of Buena Vista Lake to control the flow of water By the summer of due to the lack of rain and the construction of several irrigation ditches which had diverted much water from Kern Buena Vista and Tulare Lakes the area dried up After inspection of the drainage by the state Baker was issued a patent for acres of land in Kern Tulare and Fresno counties This was his part of the reclaimed land under the agreement From a portion of the land he gained in Kern County which happened to surrounded his homestead Baker laid out a community which eventually became the City of Bakersfield Now that the Bakers were settled in their new Kern Island home other people became attracted to the area and settlers started to trickle in A Stage line ran between Los Angeles and Sacramento Along its route freight loads of provisions began making their way regularly to Kern Island Colonel Baker s island became a regular stopping off place for all travelers journeying through the San Joaquin Valley With the help of Indians he cleared a place for a home garden in which he raised corn beans and potatoes His son Thomas A Baker often mentioned the fact that some of the cornstalks grew to be feet high and an ear of corn shelled an even quart By the valley was suffering from the second year of drought Until that occurrence wild grass grew in abundance between the town and the nearby hills It was so plentiful that the residents took it up in bundles hauling it off to their ranches where they used it as feed for the livestock Each year Colonel Baker stashed away tons of this grass which he used as hay not only for his own stock but for his guests animals as well Baker s Field was right on the main road between San Francisco and Los Angeles Travelers en route were able to take advantage of the Colonel s hospitality by stopping over and setting their stock out to pasture in what they naturally enough dubbed Colonel Baker s Field It was truly the only spot along the entire route save for Visalia where they could find food for themselves and their animals As was seen in Tom Baker s comments Baker and his family kept an open house policy in genuine Southern style and it was not long before they had gained a well deserved reputation for feeding and lodging travelers and their stock whether they came in the daytime or at night The Colonel and Mrs Baker warmly welcomed each and every traveler He would not only give them meals and a room for the night but he also fed the animals He never asked or accepted money for any of these services and courtesies but considered himself well repaid by the pleasure his open handed hospitality furnished him In November an epidemic of typhoid fever ravaged those living in and around Baker s Field and among the first stricken was the year old Colonel Baker So great was the grief of the stunned community he had founded that until after the funeral the following Tuesday all business and social activity was halted During his life Baker felt compelled to make life better for the ordinary citizen He was a staunch states rights advocate enough to be arrested for treason after his comments on the issue during the beginning of the War Between the States Baker had a deep seated need to bring change to the ordinary way of life on the frontier Because of this he was able to turn a malarial sw into the bustling community of Bakersfield California About the Author Chris Brewer is the great great grandson of Colonel Thomas Baker His grandmother was Diamond Baker Mr Brewer was raised in Bakersfield and now resides in Exeter Ca where he is a commercial orange grower and historian The above article is excerpted from Mr Brewer s upcoming biography on Colonel Baker and the Baker Family due out in To contact Chris Brewer send email to vintage lightspeed

Class Electronic Musician Live Design millimeter Mix Onstage Radio magazine Remix Sound Video Contractor Video Systems Prism Business Media Producer Roy Thomas Baker Lights Up the Darkness By Paul Tingen Mar PM The Darkness from left bassist Richie Edwards drummer Ed Graham vocalist guitarist Justin Hawkins and guitarist Dan Hawkins The members of British heavy rock band The Darkness don t take themselves too seriously With tongue somewhere near cheek they say that their concerns during the recording of their new album One Way Ticket to Hell And Back included the exhaustion and the fear the pressure paranoia and pan pipes the breakdowns and the breakups the sackings sitar solos and endless studio sessions Mix will leave the paranoia breakdowns and sackings to the tabloids but we definitely want to know more about the endless studio sessions The man in the know is Roy Thomas Baker the legendary producer behind pioneering albums by Queen The Cars Journey Foreigner Devo and many many more The pairing of Baker and The Darkness is a marriage made in heaven and has been in the cards ever since the band entered the public consciousness with Permission to Land which sold some million copies in Take a lead singer dis graced with leotard suits and a balls in the bench vice falsetto add music that takes its inspiration from s hard rock season with lots of operatic pomp and you have a band that can lay claim to being the st century heirs to the likes of Led Zeppelin Queen AC DC Slade and other rock bands from rock s golden age Baker s name meanwhile will forever be associated with Queen albums such as Queen II and Night at the Opera which contained the track Bohemian Rhapsody the band s ode to rock n roll bombast and was filled to the brim with overdubs It was the highpoint of what Baker calls his kitchen sink production time Any idea that we had we just threw it on It looks as if Baker has revived his kitchen sink production approach with The Darkness And how On the phone from his studio near Lake Havasu Ariz Baker frequently roars with laughter as he describes the Spinal Tap like excesses that went into the creation of One Way Ticket to Hell And Back They include odd guitars in the control room Don t touch em don t even point at em up to guitar overdubs per song and a similar number of vocal overdubs orchestras bagpipes a sitar and yes a pan flute Everything ended up on reels of track tape and some songs expanded to tracks before they were whittled down to tracks for final mixing It truly boggles the mind and begs for the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth Pre production for One Way Ticket to Hell And Back began in earnest in October when Baker flew over to the UK to work with the band They are pretty unique songwriters and they churn out a song a minute recalls Baker We had what seemed like thousands of songs The whole purpose for me as a producer in being there was to work out what the best parts were and help evolve them We were working arrangements out as we went along and ended up with very clear ideas of the kind of arrangements that we wanted In the beginning of Baker and band moved to Rockfield Studios in Wales where the producer had cut Bohemian Rhapsody The Darkness hired both studios for the first half of and for several months Baker had the band over a barrel recording the backing tracks mostly drums bass and rhythm guitars in endless different configurations and locations all to get the densely subtly and richly textured sound he was after The story goes that you had as many as overdubs in some songs Oh of course there were at least guitar parts in many of the songs Dan Hawkins the band s rhythm guitarist has a lot of different guitars and so we went Okay the first half of this verse sounds good on this guitar but why don t we change to a different guitar in the second half and then go back to the first guitar for the chorus but in a different tuning or with different strings or a different lifier or a different microphone and so on By the time we multitracked all those we ended up with up to guitar parts on a good deal of the songs If you listen closely one set of guitars will come in and then a totally different set of guitars and then yet another set of guitars In some places there may be a bunch of guitars that comes in for just two seconds Producer Roy Thomas Baker the man behind the endless studio sessions has worked on numerous rock records photo Jim Steinfeldt That sounds like a massive amount of work How did you keep that in focus when working with the guitarist I like to have the guitarist and all his guitars and his lifiers in the control room so the guitars are all at the same temperature and you never spend half an hour waiting for a guitar to stabilize and remain in tune I also can have complete communication with the guitarist all the time With the sound coming back from the monitors you instantly know whether you have the right sound or not Dan had between and guitars in the control room during this stage of the recording The heads are all in the control room because it s far better to push a signal than to pull it running a short lead from the guitar to the guitar is better than running a long lead from control room to studio We had the speaker cabinets outside the control room wired in such a way that we could connect any head to any cabinet each lead was marked and also had all the cabinets in different rooms The microphones could be everywhere hung from the ceiling lying on the floor and so on but we often had dynamic mics for close up and antique tube like mics for ambient The microphones themselves were of every conceivable vintage and make and we had everything ready to record via a pre of our choice After the Rockfield period you went to Whitfield Street Studios in London What did you do there Justin Hawkins lead guitar and vocals keyboards not many people know that he s one of the world s best keyboard players and the bagpipes During the vocal recording Justin was in the recording area just behind the glass We used the full ambience of the studio itself and I put a whole slew of microphones around him he looked a little bit like the president does during a press conference All the mics went to the Neve mic pre s which have a great sound Because I could have the mic pre s next to where Justin was singing the signals were pushed into the control room which gives a much better S N ratio We might use one or two or six microphones at all sorts of different levels EQ settings and so on to get the right vocal sound for a part of a given song Sometimes each line of each verse would have a different sound I would also run his voice through a compressor like a Fairchild or something I particularly like a Tube Tech compressor going into a Tube Tech EQ On a track like Blind Man we could have vocal overdubs with me changing the sound of every part especially the low ones All this may sound a bit complicated but it ended up being excessively slick Obviously his voice would sometimes get tired and then he would go on to playing keyboards or guitar You also recorded an orchestra at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles on odd tracks How much material did you end up with Oh I filled about reels of track tape We must have used the world s entire supply of tape at the time We were trying to get a hold of more tape because we were wiping tapes that we had already used to make space for new overdubs We had bunches of slaves We might have a whole slew of guitars on one slave and then submix those to two tracks on another slave and carry on overdubbing onto that one We were always submixing and bouncing backward and forward It was very very time consuming How on earth did you organize all that material We were making a massive sounding type of record We were going for a huge huge production sound hence all the overdubs But we did not want to make a retro record We wanted to get the best of both worlds of old and new I wanted to make a modern record Since the aim was to go for the big hybrid sound we used analog track to record on and then transferred everything to Pro Tools HD and did our editing in there I like utilizing the best aspects of both It sounds like doing everything in Pro Tools from the start would have made life much easier for you Analog gives you a nice full texture that you cannot get any other way When recording on analog I make sure that the levels are at full tilt and the red lights are flashing I press it exceptionally hard For this reason I don t need to use Dolby We align the tapes so that everything is just on the verge of distorting and the tape acts like a giant compressor It s why I don t like to use outboard compressors during the recording stage because you stop the sound of tape compression from happening You mixed at the The Village in Los Angeles Why I know the studio inside out and I really like mixing on their Neve R I felt it was good to mix on something that s discrete I m a big fan of Neve We did a lot of sub bouncing inside of Pro Tools before mixing Some tracks had loads and loads of guitars and vocals and we d end up with tracks otherwise That s impossible so we got everything down to tracks We then set Pro Tools up with the Neve R and started mixing I don t like mixing inside of Pro Tools because it feels a bit Mickey Mouse to me when you need a cursor to push up and down faders and so on Can you describe the mixing process For me mixing is mainly balancing and giving the final tweaks sound wise Since I don t add much compression during recording I may add compression I ll be using old and new stuff during mixing like Fairchild Summit or Tube Tech Instead of sticking a Lexicon on the vocals I used natural echo echo chambers plates or slap tape echo And we mixed the album to half inch analog on an Ampex track and also back into Pro Tools as a comparison We listened to both and found that the analog had a nice big saturated bass sound while the digital had a really nice crispy top end We ended up using the analog mix for mastering adding some treble to make it sound as sparkling at the top end as the digital did Again about the excessive amount of material that you amassed How did you keep a clear head over what s good and what s bad You have to be mentally organized and make very good notes of everything you do There were recording engineers who made sure that it all got to tape and who did the transfers to Pro Tools which was also a task But for me there s no risk of not seeing the trees for the wood It s totally the opposite You get focused on what you think is appropriate for a song and then you tune into different microphones and pre s and EQs and so on You have to know what your goal is The band and I had discussed beforehand what we planned to do and we mapped it out before we went into the studio Of course it changes it always changes In the studio you re running percent on instinct and you sometimes end up with something that s a lot better than you had planned But the structure of every song on the album is exactly the way it was planned out to be We had a vision of how the record was going to pan out and we stuck to that vision unless happy accidents happened And I think we pulled it off Want to use this article Click here for options Prism Business Media Inc

'A Grammar of Dublin Core Search Back Issues Author Index Title Index Contents D Lib Magazine October Volume Number ISSN A Grammar of Dublin Core Thomas Baker GMD German National Research Center for Information Technology Scientific Library and Publication Services Schloss Birlinghoven D Sankt Augustin Germany thomas baker gmd de We begin with the sentence because the sentence is the unit of discourse because words can be classified only from their function in the sentence and because the pupil should from the outset see that what determines the words in the sentence and the sentence itself is the thought Alonso Reed and Brainerd Kellogg Higher Lessons in English Dublin Core Made Simple Dublin Core as a Language Dublin Core is often presented as a modern form of catalog card a set of elements and now qualifiers that describe resources in a complete package Sometimes it is proposed as an exchange format for sharing records among multiple collections The founding principle that every element is optional and repeatable reinforces the notion that a Dublin Core description is to be taken as a whole This paper in contrast is based on a much different premise Dublin Core is a language More precisely it is a small language for making a particular class of statements about resources Like natural languages it has a vocabulary of word like terms the two classes of which elements and qualifiers function within statements like nouns and adjectives and it has a syntax for arranging elements and qualifiers into statements according to a simple pattern A Pidgin for Digital Tourists Whenever tourists order a meal or ask directions in an unfamiliar language considerate native speakers will spontaneously limit themselves to basic words and simple sentence patterns along the lines of I am so and so or This is such and such Linguists call this pidginization In such situations a small phrase book or translated menu can be most helpful By analogy today s Web has been called an Internet Commons where users and information providers from a wide range of scientific commercial and social domains present their information in a variety of incompatible data models and description languages In this context Dublin Core presents itself as a metadata pidgin for digital tourists who must find their way in this linguistically diverse landscape Its vocabulary is small enough to learn quickly and its basic pattern is easily grasped It is well suited to serve as an auxiliary language for digital libraries This Grammar This grammar starts by defining terms It then follows a year old tradition of English grammar teaching by focusing on the structure of single statements see the Reed and Kellogg e above It concludes by looking at the growing dictionary of Dublin Core vocabulary terms its registry and at how statements can be used to build the metadata equivalent of paragraphs and compositions the application profile Elements and Qualifiers Vocabulary terms in general Strictly speaking a Dublin Core element or qualifier is a unique identifier formed by a name e g title prefixed by the URI of the namespace in which it is defined as in http dublincore org dces title In this context a namespace is a vocabulary that has been formally published usually on the Web it describes elements and qualifiers with natural language labels definitions and other relevant documentation Currently there are two namespaces for Dublin Core the Dublin Core element set and the Dublin Core Qualifiers denoted here by the conventional abbreviations dc and dcq DCMI DCMI In this paper as in many application environments the elements and qualifiers are referred to in a machine readable short form such as dc title Elements The fifteen elements of the Dublin Core element set are the defining feature of Dublin Core as a language In their short form the elements are dc title dc creator dc subject dc description dc publisher dc contributor dc date dc type dc format dc identifier dc source dc language dc relation dc coverage and dc rights These correspond to fifteen broadly defined properties of resources that are generally useful for searching across repositories in multiple domains Qualifiers Qualifiers modify the properties of Dublin Core statements by specifying in the manner of natural language adjectives what kind of subject date or relation Qualifiers currently fall into two classes Encoding schemes are pointers to contextual information or parsing rules that aid in the interpretation of an element value For ex le dcq lcsh qualifies dc subject to specify that the keywords are a Library of Congress Subject Heading and dcq iso qualifies dc date to specify that the string is formatted according to an international standard Element refinements make a property more specific without extending its meaning such as dcq revised as a modifier of dc date yielding date revised In July a DCMI Usage Committee recommended a batch of fifty two qualifiers to exemplify these principles of qualification but the qualifiers for Dublin Core statements may also come from other namespaces as in the ex le yans author below where yans is a hypothetical YetAnotherNameSpace Elements and qualifiers defined in languages other than English Strictly speaking elements and qualifiers are represented by machine readable tokens that stand for general concepts such as title subject and date The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative discusses and approves their definitions in English In principle however they can be labelled and defined equally well in any other language such as Dutch or Arabic or Thai For ex le dc creator may be labeled Creatore in Italian Pencipta in Bahasa Indonesian or Verfasser in German Baker To date the element set has been translated into twenty six languages Bear in mind as you read that although this grammar is written in English a Japanese version could translate every English word here into Japanese all grammar terms and ex le sentences included except for the English like names of the tokens themselves Dublin Core Statements Diagramming statements Since the s the grammar of sentences has been taught in American high schools using sentence diagrams Reed and Kellogg House and Harman Warriner et al This style has a binary flavor the sentence baseline is intersected to divide the subject that of which something is said from the predicate that which is said of the subject Within the predicate a smaller line separates the object in Dublin Core terms the property from the objective complement in Dublin Core the property value This style is nicely expressive of Dublin Core because the qualifiers hanging below the baseline on slanted lines are visibly subordinate to the properties they modify see Figures and Figure The general pattern Parts of a Statement Dublin Core is in effect a class of statements of the pattern Resource has property X where resource is the implied subject followed by an implied verb has followed by one of fifteen properties from the Dublin Core element set followed by a property value an appropriate literal such as a person s name a date some words or a URL For ex le Resource has dc creator Tom Baker and Resource has dc date Optional qualifiers may make the meaning of a property more definite as in Resource has dc date dcq revised Principles of Qualification The qualification of Dublin Core properties is guided by a rule known colloquially as the Dumb Down Principle According to this rule a client should be able to ignore any qualifier and use the description as if it were unqualified While this may result in some loss of specificity the remaining element value minus the qualifier must continue to be generally correct and useful for discovery DCMI Qualification is therefore supposed only to refine not extend the semantic scope of a property In borderline cases qualification should not result in a literal that could be misleading Appropriate Literals Whether a property value is useful for discovery is at the heart of the notion of appropriateness A property value should be a string of an expected type usually for ex le some sort of name for dc creator dc contributor dc publisher or dc title a URL for dc relation dc identifier or dc source full text sentences for dc description short text strings or keywords for dc subject dc type dc format and dc language and a recognizable combination of years months and days for dc date Both in theory and in practice the range of expected data types varies from property to property which types are appropriate for a given property is open to interpretation and debate see below Evaluating Statements To test whether a Dublin Core statement is conceptually solid cover the qualifiers with your hand dumbing down read the statement above the line and ask Does it make sense Is it factually and logically correct Is the literal appropriate for the given property Ex les Figure Some statements diagrammed Resource has dc title A Grammar of Dublin Core Does it make sense Yes Is it correct Yes Is the literal appropriate Yes a sequence of words is normal and expected for the property dc title Resource has dcq iso dcq revised dc date This means that a resource was revised on June The statement dumbs down to Resource has dc date which means that the date June has something to do with the life cycle of the resource This is less specific than the qualified statement but still correct Resource has dcq lcsh dc subject Languages Grammar This says that the resource is about the subject grammar of languages and that these words are a controlled term from the Library of Congress Subject Headings The statement dumbs down to Resource has dc subject Languages Grammar which makes sense even if we do not know that the term comes from the Library of Congress Resource has yans cerif dc subject H Grammar semantics semiotics syntax This literal includes a language independent abbreviation H which will be useful for applications that understand yans cerif The string H may confuse some users but otherwise does no harm Resource has yans author dc creator Tom Baker Users of the yans namespace will recognize that yans author is being used here as an adjective modifying dc creator just as talk is an adjective modifying show in the phrase talk show It is an awkward but correct way to say that Tom Baker is the author sort of creator i e the author of the resource This statement dumbs down to Resource has dc creator Tom Baker less specific but still correct Resource has dc relation http www dlib org dlib december baker html The statement asserts that the resource is somehow related to an article in D Lib Magazine a URL is appropriate as a literal for dc relation Some not so good ex les Resource has dc creator name given Thomas name family Baker employer GMD contact Schloss Birlinghoven D Sankt Augustin A reader can see what this compound or structured value is saying But a search engine would need to know how to parse out the components and suppress the tags in order to index this cleanly lest a search for creators named Augustin should yield false hits Generally speaking things like affiliations and addresses properties of the creator of a resource do not belong in Dublin Core statements about the resource itself Metadata providers that used such compound values within specific usage communities could speak Dublin Core to the rest of the world by exporting just the name Resource has dc creator Thomas Baker Resource has yans creator Tom Baker This statement is useful for applications that recognize the yans namespace but it is not a Dublin Core statement per se If the yans and dc definitions of Creator were compatible either the metadata provider or an indexing application could use a crosswalk to translate this into the Dublin Core statement Resource has dc creator Tom Baker Ongoing Issues Fifteen fuzzy buckets The properties of Dublin Core are like fifteen big buckets and the rules about which types of literals may be placed in those buckets are somewhat fuzzy This fuzziness is intentional the Internet is a diverse and chaotic place where a more disciplined top down approach to standardization is unrealistic especially for use across multiple domains and languages If the rules of Dublin Core were more precise people would inevitably bend them In the jargon of computer science then Dublin Core is weakly typed as a language A search engine may find a variety of information types in any given bucket from URLs to non textual alphanumeric strings to full text in any language The appropriateness of literals Requirements for the appropriateness of a literal are in practice somewhat contradictory Ideally a literal should be useful for discovery which means it should make sense as is to the average user Yet it should also be processable in an expected way by search engines Programmers need to be know for ex le when to index on strings separated by white space minus punctuation and stop words when to expect a URL and when to expect an alphanumeric date string Some elements are particularly ambiguous in this regard Dc rights for ex le can be free text or a URL Dc coverage can be a place name the name of a time period a numeric identifier for a place or time or even a compound value in effect a miniature schema with multiple sub components separated by semicolons or XML tags Where such a range of data types is permissible should it be acceptable to relax the Dumb Down Principle Should qualifiers in effect modify the expected data type of the literal Or should the presence of say XML angle brackets be expected to trigger automatically a change in parsing algorithms Would such a complexification of a property compensate for the corresponding loss of Dublin Core s overall simplicity Or can the need for complex description be resolved in a broader framework outside Dublin Core per se Application profiles One broader framework for such a resolution is the application profile As currently defined application profiles are the metadata equivalent of regional idioms or creoles complexified pidgins Implementors who need an application language more expressive than a pidgin may combine elements and qualifiers from Dublin Core with elements from other namespaces into a richer vocabulary or embed them into a syntactically more sophisticated data model Such linguistic innovation is considered by many people to be reasonable as long as implementors respect a distinction between namespaces where elements and qualifiers are given standard definitions and profiles where elements from multiple namespaces are only reused combined adapted and constrained Heery The profile then is the natural locus for full descriptions the catalog card or metadata package taken as a whole For ex le the Collection Description Schema of the Research Support Libraries Programme RSLP in the UK uses dc title officially defined as a name given to the resource but defines it more narrowly as a name given to the collection Alongside such Dublin Core elements it uses elements from other namespaces such as cld accessConditions for the hours of access and classes of permitted users from a local Collection Level Description namespace These elements are framed in a data model that specifies typical relationships between a collection its individual items a collector an owner a location and the constituent parts of a collection each of which may be described with multiple attributes RSLP An RSLP description does not talk just about information resources per se but also about the people organizations and access frameworks related to those resources Developing profiles and coining new elements Some working groups of DCMI are developing domain specific profiles of Dublin Core surveying the descriptive needs of domains such as education and government to determine an appropriate mix of Dublin Core elements and elements from other namespaces and perhaps to coin additional elements for concepts not covered in existing standards These working groups need to consider that literals appropriate to domain specialists may not make much sense to general users especially in statements that have been dumbed down As the ex le above makes clear moreover core elements are needed for classes of resources other than document like objects such as people and organizations generically agents and spatially and temporally grounded events Urgently required are data model conventions for combining multiple entities within an application profile for ex le to include an author s affiliation and address in the description for a resource and stable formats for the encoding of profiles as XML or RDF schemas Building a dictionary registry for Dublin Core Historically the standardization of national languages such as English has been helped by the compilation of dictionaries Good dictionaries often strike a balance between pre scribing guidelines for good style and de scribing a living language with ex les of actual usage Metadata languages like Dublin Core have hitherto been developed prescriptively in standards committees as there have been no convenient ways to track local innovations in usage and feed them back into the standardization process However several related developments are now enabling the collective construction of metadata dictionaries or registries The new Resource Description Framework RDF Schemas standard of the World Wide Web Consortium provides a format for publishing schemas that can be harvested by metadata search engines W C Eric Miller has developed an open source software toolkit for indexing a distributed corpus of RDF schemas as one huge database with an interface for following hyperlinked cross references between related terms in namespaces and profiles in effect a metadata schema browser EOR The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is using this toolkit to manage its namespace Open Metadata Registry and a working group is formulating technical and policy guidelines for its ongoing management DC Registry A European project SCHEMAS is promoting the use of RDF schemas to help harmonize metadata practice among EU funded projects and is using RDF to build a layer of annotated pointers to namespaces profiles and metadata activities generally SCHEMAS Does your application speak Dublin Core Pidgins are inherently limited in what they can express but they are easy to learn and enormously useful In real life we talk one way to our professional colleagues and another way to visitors from other cultures Our digital library applications need to do this as well Simplicity and complexity are both appropriate depending on context If Dublin Core is too simple or generic to use as the native idiom of a particular application pidgin statements may be extracted or translated from richer idioms that exist for specialized domains This output should also be filtered to keep the fifteen buckets clear of encoding debris and semantic silt One should treat digital tourists with courtesy and hide from them the complexities of a local application vocabulary or grammar However sophisticated its local idiom may be an application might also speak a pidgin that general users and generic search engines will understand Simple semantically clean computationally obvious values will help us negotiate our way through a splendidly diverse and heterogeneous Internet Appendix Dublin Core and RDF grammar compared Directed Labelled Graphs The Resource Description Framework RDF a relatively new standard of the World Wide Web Consortium is emerging as an information model and encoding format of choice for metadata and application profiles that use Dublin Core W C W C RDF is a grammar for expressing relationships among resources located or represented somewhere on the Internet These relationships are depicted graphically with Directed Labelled Graphs DLGs which use arcs predicates expressing properties to establish a relationship between multiple nodes resources Nodes are seen as subjects or objects depending on the direction of the arrow Figure The general pattern of RDF statements triples RDF triples In contrast to the binary flavor of the pedagogical English grammars cited above the model of RDF statements is a tripartite one of subject predicate and object see Figure RDF statements accordingly are called triples A property is a specific aspect characteristic attribute or relation used to describe a resource A specific resource together with the named property plus the value of that property for that resource is an RDF statement These three individual parts of a statement are called respectively the subject the predicate and the object The object of a statement i e the property value can be another resource or it can be a literal i e a resource specified by a URI or a simple string or other primitive datatype defined by XML In RDF terms a literal may have content that is XML markup but is not further evaluated by the RDF processor W C Figure shows an RDF triple consisting of the subject http www w org Home Lassila predicate has creator and object Ora Lassila Figure Directed Labelled Graph of a triple Subject of an RDF statement The subject of an RDF statement is anything that can be named by a Universal Resource Identifier URI In principle this is anything from a Web page or museum artifact to an abstract concept or event The subject of a Dublin Core statement in contrast is an anonymous information resource perhaps a document like object In Dublin Core the subject resource is always implied never named as in RDF The RDF statement in Figure then would be expressed in Dublin Core as two statements Resource has dc identifier http www w org Home Lassila and Resource has dc creator Ora Lassila As long as it is clear from the context that the two statements refer to the same resource for instance they are both in the same record one can infer that Ora Lassila has created the Web page English Dublin Core RDF words have classes tokens have classes nodes and arcs nouns elements adjectives qualifiers sentences have parts statements have parts statements have parts subject implied subject subject predicate predicate verb implied verb implied verb object property property objective complement property value object property value modifiers qualifiers Figure Grammar Terms Compared Predicate of an RDF statement The predicate of an RDF statement is an implied verb plus a property This is more restricted than the standard definition of a predicate in high school English grammar which includes in effect everything to the right of the vertical intersector in a sentence diagram that is everything within a clause that is said about a subject However since most people have only the vaguest recollection of predicates from high school this grammar avoids using the term at all Property value of RDF statements In RDF these are called objects But again there is risk of confusion with English grammar In the sentence This paper has the title A Grammar of Dublin Core some high school English grammars see A Grammar of Dublin Core as an objective complement with respect to the object of the sentence title see Figure Compounding the confusion computer scientists are oriented to objects of a much different sort and the resource of a Dublin Core statement might even be a physical object This grammar avoids the term object altogether The lack of qualifiers in RDF In Dublin Core qualifiers depend on and modify one of Dublin Core s fifteen elements properties The basic RDF model does not express this type of dependency Properties may relate to another as narrower to broader terms using the relation SubPropertyOf as Author relates to Creator In native RDF however both Author and Creator are full properties in their own right The compatibility of Dublin Core and RDF The differences between Dublin Core and RDF outlined above are largely terminological at issue is what the parts of a statement such as Resource has Property X should be called The difficulty of choosing the right words for this grammar should not obscure the basic compatibility and complementarity of Dublin Core and RDF RDF offers a general model for statements while Dublin Core offers a particular type of pidgin like statement about information resources and privileges a small set of special words RDF offers a specific encoding in XML for expressing its conceptual model while Dublin Core is by design independent of any particular encoding format RDF then is just one of the possible information models that can use tokens from Dublin Core while Dublin Core is just one of the languages expressible in RDF Footnotes It would be desirable to have a word for Dublin Core vocabulary terms in general elements and qualifiers as a whole just as natural language nouns verbs adjectives and conjunctions are all called words Unfortunately entities concepts and symbols are all too abstract and vague words are associated too closely with natural language and lexemes are too obscure The first draft of this paper spoke generically of elements and distinguished between core elements and qualifiers but veterans of Dublin Core found this confusing The next draft introduced tokens which conveys the notion that Dublin Core vocabulary terms stand for general concepts that are defined and labeled in many natural languages but people also found this confusing Vocabulary terms seems a bit cumbersome so I avoid the term whenever possible and speak simply of elements and qualifiers Early in the workshop series before it was formally called a Metadata Initiative the Dublin Core effort was declared to be primarily about semantics in contrast to syntax and the latter was declared to be out of scope In that context however syntax referred to the encoding of metadata in HTML database and later XML or RDF formats it involved questions such as which tags to place where within what angle brackets or punctuation and how to group or nest related elements This grammar in contrast presents the syntax of Dublin Core statements in a linguistic sense as the rules governing how the words of a sentence are related to each other which words modify other words and which words are of central importance in the statement In practice the reasoning behind this is circular Dublin Core properties are appropriate for any entity that has such properties This circularity has spared us a perhaps futile attempt to seek philosophical consensus on a universal ontology of entity classes and allowed us to get on with the task of describing whatever it is we are describing Dan Brickley points out that software tools could exploit additional information about entities and vocabularies to translate sequences of RDF encoded Dublin Core statements into a natural language style that flows more elegantly and reads less like a pidgin Acknowledgements I have discussed this paper with many colleagues from both DCMI and other communities

is not related to Thomas Baker as far as can be proven I have a feeling that he is a cousin to my ancestor Jacob Baker but no proof of that yet They may not be related at all Note Much family data is found in Revolutionary War Pension file R wherein Thomas widow Molly applied for a pension based on his service Note on Baker DNA Study No proven descendant of Thomas Baker has yet taken the test however if his parentage is correct he should match those in the Thomas Baker group for that Thomas is grandfather to Thomas This Baker DNA group has four participants so far all of whom are from David Baker who would be an uncle of this younger Thomas They all match one another as they should One DNA match is a descendant of Adam Jackson Baker His parents are unproven but some think he is a son of Thomas DNA certainly supports that theory but doesn t prove it Thomas Baker was born per census analysis His widow stated that he was when he died in March If correct that puts his birth year at either or both of which match his census records I don t know where he was born exactly though certainly in Virginia probably Culpeper County Thomas Baker appears to be a son of William Baker and Anne Gambill of Culpeper and Botetourt Co VA I have not researched that family but I ve seen bits of evidence that seem to support this connection When Thomas was still young his father was killed by Indians Thomas was principally raised by his uncle Martin Gambill Thomas Baker served as a Private during the Revolutionary War under Capt William Nall and Capt Martin Gambill under Col Benjamin Cleveland and Gen Griffith Rutherford After the war Thomas Baker married Mary Molly Cantrell in Wilkes County Her maiden name and the date of marriage was given in her widow s pension application In her first deposition Dec she listed Mar In another deposition Aug she listed Mar and finally in she listed Sep I assume the last is most accurate She mentioned she had no record of the marriage nor was there a marriage bond for they married by publication banns They were married in Wilkes by William Nall Justice of the Peace Mary or Molly was born ca per her age of on the census In her deposition of Dec she was listed as years old which agrees with the census entry She stated she had no record of her age and that her husband was much older than she Actually he was only about or years older Thomas Baker was not listed on the State Census of North Carolina in Wilkes County Several other Bakers were listed in that county though which see The Bakers lived with Thomas uncle Martin Gambill for a few years right after they married per Pension files However they don t actually seem to be with them on the census Martin Gambill was listed on that census in Wilkes in Capt Nall s company William Nall who was listed next door to him and whose daughter Gambill had married Gambill s household contained one male aged to born between ca and ca That would be Gambill himself He also had two boys under born ca one of which could be Thomas Baker but it doesn t quite fit There was only one female in the house which was most likely Mrs Gambill Nancy Nall Morris Baker was just two houses away That suggests but doesn t prove a relationship between the two Baker families Thomas Baker is listed on the census in Wilkes County He was in the th Company There was one other Baker

Zechariah Baker and James Baker these last two were also on South Fork Thomas Baker was listed on the census in Ashe Co NC There were quite a few Baker families in Ashe County NC which see Unfortunately the Ashe County census was alphabetical so we can t determine where anyone lived nor who their neighbors were census analysis based on available evidence Explanation of this census Ashe Co NC pg Thomas Baker Analysis Male s up before Thomas BAKER Male s Son gt gone by Male s Son gt gone by Son Female s up before Mary Cantrell baker wife Female s Daughter Daughter gt gone by Female s Daughter gt gone by Daughter gt gone by Female s Daughter gt gone by Daughter Thomas Baker was still in Ashe Co NC for the census which see Fortunately this one was in the original order so we can determine more or less where each person lived and who their neighbors were James Baker was five houses away Hiram Baker was three houses away census analysis based on available evidence Explanation of this census Ashe Co NC pg Thomas Baker Analysis Male s Thomas BAKER Male s Son Male s Son Female s Mary Cantrell Baker wife Female s Daughter Female s Daughter Thomas Baker died either on Mar or Mar both dates given in Mary s Pension Affidavits in Ashe Co NC The last affidavit gave Mar as the date so it was probably more accurate I was unable to find widow Mary Cantrell Baker on the census She was not a head of household nor did any of the Baker households which see have a female her age residing with them She was probably with a married daughter that year For the census widow Mary was living in Ashe County with the James and Jane Ready or Reedy family One would assume that Jane was Mary s daughter or granddaughter The only Baker nearby was Adam Jackson Baker c who was ten households away Others list him as her son but I ve seen no proof yet other than proximity census abstract Explanation of this census Note The dates at the end of each line are not part of the original census but are approximate birth years based on age ASHE CO NC Page B House Family READY JAMES M W FARMER NC READY JANE F W NC READY WILLIAM M W NC READY ELIZABETH F W NC BAKER MARY F W NC In the s through widow Molly Baker made several affidavits to get a Pension based on her late husband s Revolutionary War service These are recorded in Pension File R Mrs Nancy Gambill aged widow of Martin Gambill also made a statement on her behalf in I didn t find Mary Molly Cantrell Baker on the census She probably died before then Children of Thomas Baker and Mary Cantrell Thomas Baker had lots of children per the through census records I have not identified any of them yet though I suspect that Hiram Baker c is his son but have no solid proof In the Pension files it is mentioned the first two children a boy and a girl died young but that they raised a large family Unfortunately none of them were named In Mary s last affidavit in a Mr John W Baldwin and a Mary Baker were witnesses One would assume they were related but I don t know how Widow Mary Cantrell Baker was living with James and Jane Ready in Jane was born ca per that census and close to that per This doesn t match any of Thomas and Mary s children per the census records This suggests that Mary could be a granddaughter or perhaps not even related I m listing Jane as a grandchild of Thomas and Mary for now just so I don t lose track of her Unknown Son Unknown Daughter Unknown Son Unknown Daughter Unknown Daughter Unknown Daughter Unknown Daughter Unknown Son Unknown Daughter Unknown Daughter Unknown Son Unknown Son Unknown Daughter Unknown Daughter Unknown Son Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age He was home with him in aged under born ca and still home in aged born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was not home with him in or but was home in aged born ca This absence from the earlier records may indicate that this isn t a daughter at all but someone else who was just living with him in She was no longer with him by Unknown Son Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age He was home in aged under born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was not home in but was with him in aged born ca and gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was not home in but was with him in aged born ca and gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was not home in but was with him in aged born ca and still home in aged born ca and still home in aged born ca Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was home in aged under born ca and still home in age born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Son Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age He was home with him in aged under born ca and still home in aged born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then I strongly suspect that this unknown son is Hiram Baker c My proof is all circumstantial Hiram was near Thomas on the census Hiram named his oldest son Thomas Thomas did have an unidentified son this age per census analysis One flaw with the above is in DNA test results A descendant of Hiram Baker has taken the DNA test and his results do not match those in the Thomas Baker group If Hiram was a son of Thomas his male Baker descendants should have nearly identical Y Chromosome DNA results In fact as of this writing the Hiram Baker DNA results match no one else in the Baker DNA study DNA test results seem to remove Thomas from being a candidate for Hiram s father However with just one test result we can t rule it out completely There are always anomalies If a second proven descendant of Hiram from a different branch of his family were to take the test and his results matched the others then that would prove there is probably no anomaly See Hiram s page for more on him Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was home with him in aged under born ca and still home in aged born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was home with him in aged under born ca and still home in aged born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Son Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age He was home with him in aged under born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Son Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age He was home with him in aged under born ca and still home in aged born ca This could be Adam Jackson Baker c I have no direct evidence linking them but Jackson Baker was very close to widow Mary Cantrell Baker on the census in fact the only Baker listed even remotely close to her He does fit age wise I have nothing else that connects them though See his own page for more on him A descendant of Adam Jackson Baker has taken the DNA test and his results match those in the Thomas Baker group This means he certainly could be a son of Thomas Baker It doesn t prove they are father and son but it certainly proves they are related Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age She was home with him in aged under born ca but gone by so probably married or dead by then Unknown Daughter Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this

patient It also is the only text which explains treatment on a histological basis The authors are to be congratulated for their excellent teaching Head Neck January Reviewer Raj P Terkonda M D I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it to residents and practicing physicians who are performing facial cosmetic surgery I found this book easier to read more practical and more comprehensive than many of the other texts about facial peels The importance of skin care as a useful adjunct for optimizing results in facial aesthetic surgery cannot be emphasized enough Back

'Two Columbus Legacies Alma Thomas and Lamar Baker Editor s note The Columbus Museum provided source material to Resource Library for the following article If you have questions or comments regarding the source material please contact the Columbus Museum directly through either this phone number or web address http www columbusmuseum com Two Columbus Legacies Alma Thomas and Lamar Baker November February T he Columbus Museum is paying tribute to the artistic achievements of Georgia natives Alma Thomas and Lamar Baker in the exhibition Two Columbus Legacies The exhibit on view in the Museum s Shorter Leebern Gallery from November to February features approximately prints drawings and paintings by the two artists that are drawn from the Columbus Museum s extensive holdings Thomas vibrant abstractions came to international prominence in when she became the first African American woman to be awarded a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art Although influenced by earlier modern masters such as Matisse and Picasso her work was perhaps more shaped by her fascination with the optical effects of pure color and with natural forms especially flowers Baker achieved national recognition for his socially and politically charged prints many of which depict African American life in the South The artist s images reflect his keen interest in gospel music as well as folk art and surrealism A special website for this exhibition has been developed The site which includes details about the artists images family activities and information for educators and students can be accessed at a computer kiosk in the exhibition Alma Thomas and Lamar Baker were two exceptional artists who experienced firsthand the dramatic changes in the American art world during much of the twentieth century Both were Southerners who established successful careers in major art centers in the North Both became involved in art movements of national importance and drew their inspiration from direct observations of contemporary life Both have ties to Columbus the city was Thomas birthplace and the place in which the Atlanta born Baker spent much of his later life Beyond these few similarities however the two artists pursued remarkably different paths Alma Thomas was a woman of color who escaped racial prejudices in the South by moving to Washington DC where she eventually became a prominent abstract painter Thomas rejected the notion of painting stereotypically black subjects and instead embraced modernism in her quest to develop a universal language of color and form The primary inspiration for the artist s luminous abstractions was the natural beauty she sought in outdoor settings especially flower gardens Although white Lamar Baker made regular trips from his studio in New York City to Atlanta where he depicted with great conviction and detail such topics as political corruption social injustice poverty and above all the difficult circumstances of African American life in the South the same factors that had driven Alma Thomas to leave Columbus as a teenager in In fact influential curator and critic Carl Zigrosser once referred to him as one of the first native artists to reckon with the problems of the new South Unlike Thomas Baker employed a clear narrative style remained highly suspicious of avant garde art movements and produced his most inspired work early in his career between and Alma Thomas however was a fiercely modern artist who did not reach her full potential as an artist until age after she retired from teaching and devoted her full time energies to painting right Lamar Baker Self Portrait with Cotton Plant lithograph x inches Museum purchase Featuring nearly objects Two Legacies celebrates the Columbus Museum s extensive holdings by Thomas and Baker and focuses special attention on their works on paper Both artists considered paper an important and versatile support material for their artistic creations in a variety of media For Thomas watercolor and gouache were principal modes of experimentation and she relished the watery washes of translucent color as well as the dense controlled color shapes that these media afforded Baker created numerous drawings and watercolors but produced much of his most compelling and inspired work in the form of lithographic prints made by drawing in greasy crayon on a fine grained stone that is moistened with water rubbed with an oily ink that adheres to the dry waxy marks only and then run through a press This exhibition represents the first time the bulk of the Columbus Museum s holdings by the two artists have been shown and the first time they have been presented together The Museum is grateful to the late Miss John Maurice Thomas and the family of Alma Thomas for its important gift of what certainly stands as one of the largest collections of Thomas s works on paper In addition the Museum acknowledges the generosity of Lamar Baker who bequeathed the prints paintings and drawings in what now represents the most extensive body of Baker s work in existence This exhibit is sponsored by generous funding from the Fifth Generation Foundation On Saturday February from p m visitors may view films about African American artists including Alma Thomas A Life in Art This free program is open to all ages Editor s note RL readers may read more about Lamar

'Baker Knight By John Chintala Although Dean Martin fans might not instantly recognize the name Baker Knight they certainly know the songs he s written Such Dino hits as Somewhere There s A Someone and Not Enough Indians as well as the classic ballads That Old Time Feelin and If You Ever Get Around To Loving Me all came from the pen of Baker Knight He was born Thomas Baker Knight Jr in Birmingham Alabama on the Fourth of July in After graduating high school Baker served years in the Air Force where he learned to play the guitar Following his stint in the service Baker attended the University of Alabama as well as an art school in Birmingham and became a technical illustrator and draftsman But when Elvis Presley took the music industry by storm in Baker dusted off his guitar formed a rock band with several musician friends and Baker Knight and the Knightmares was born Their most popular single Bring My Cadillac Back was written by Baker and sold a reported copies in two weeks However executives felt it was a free commercial for Caddys so it was taken off the air Subsequent releases didn t fare any better and Baker soon found himself back to square one After relocating to Los Angeles for a movie role that never materialized Baker admits he had less than a dollar to his name when destiny arrived in the form of a teenage idol A mutual friend introduced Baker to Ricky Nelson and the rest as they say is part of music history Baker played a few of his songs for Nelson including the melancholy ballad Lonesome Town Less than six months later in November it reached Billboard s Top Ten as did its flip side I got A Feeling another Knight tune In recent years Lonesome Town was featured in a memorable television commercial for a soft drink heard in several major motion pictures and recorded by Paul McCartney on his album Run Devil Run Ricky Nelson would go on to record more Baker Knight originals including the top ten hits Never Be Anyone Else But You and Sweeter Than You On January Dean Martin cut his classic rendition of Baker s Somewhere There s A Someone the first of eleven Knight compositions than Dino would record over the next six years In Baker s original rock and roll inspiration Elvis Presley released Knight s The Wonder Of You which reached the summit of the easy listening chart and also went top ten on Billboard s Hot During the Bicentennial Year Dave and Sugar had a number three country hit with Baker s I m Gonna Love you and Mickey Gilley s version of Knight s Don t The Girls All Get Prettier At Closing Time topped the country charts and won the Academy of Country Music s Song Of The Year award In Baker contracted infectious mononucleosis for the second time as an adult It progressed into what is now termed the Chronic Fatigue Fibromyalgia Syndrome Although this illness greatly limited Knight s activities including his ability to record in commercial studios he had a small facility built in his house and continued writing and recording songs Last year Baker released his first ever solo CD The Way I Hear It which contains twelve songs that he s written during the past decade plus his own interpretation of Lonesome Town Baker sang every vocal part produced arranged and engineered this labor of love that took nearly three years to complete Among the standout tracks are the ballads I Can t Leave You Even Though You re Gone You re the Only One That I Still Look For In A Crowd and a humorous commentary on so called technological advancements called The Computer Is Down These songs along with his newest CD Music is My Woman and his first all instrumental CD Music for Romantic Dreamers illustrate that after plus years in the business Knight still has his gift of melody and talented way with words Baker Knight s CD is available through his website as well as on Amazon com Over the course of his career Baker has received two Million Performance Award certifications from BMI Broadcast Music Incorporated for Lonesome Town and Never Be Anyone Else But You while The Wonder Of You recently received certification for two million performances Knight also has eight BMI Citation of Achievement awards to his credit In addition to his success as a songwriter Baker Knight s personal life has been blessed with two children His daughter Tuesday Lynn Knight is perhaps best known for her lead role as Kristen Parker in the horror flick Nightmare On Elm Street while his son Thomas Baker Knight III is a doctor of Veterinary medicine and an award winning taxidermist who resides in Florida Last August th I had the pleasure of speaking with Baker Knight via telephone from his home in Alabama He was more than eager to share anecdotes about some of the songs he wrote for Dean Martin as well as personal insights into the man himself I began by asking him how he started writing songs for Dino I was in a Sherman Oaks pool hall one afternoon and I was kinda bemoaning problems with my marriage not working out Some of it was because I worked at night Anyway I walked out of the pool hall and there was this beautiful girl riding in a car And she just craned her neck all the way around to look at me like she just saw an ice cream sundae or something And I said Good Lord somewhere there s a someone for everyone I know it The Next two songs of yours that Dean recorded were One Lonely Boy and Nobody s Baby Again I think a lot of the songs I wrote around this time were about my marriage not working out It just wasn t the most pleasant thing for either one of us we just weren t cut out for each other But we have a beautiful daughter and still talk and get along to this day Dean recorded If I Ever Get Back To Georgia on the Happiness Is Dean Martin album At the time he was into country type stuff and we were trying to come up with something that might be considered in that vein I think that s why I came up with that one You know humorist George Grizzard wrote a book titled If I ever Get Back To Georgia I m Gonna Nail My Feet To The Ground He liked one of my other songs and wrote about it a couple of times in his column so I think he got the title for his book from that song A Place In The Shade reminded me a lot of Bumming Around Yeah that was kinda my idea I loved the way Dean sang he really enjoyed singing you could tell You know he didn t really care for people who got up there and tried to make every note clear and perfect So I just tried to get into his groove as well as I could That Old Time Feelin and Not Enough Indians were both on the Gentle On My Mind album I think Feelin was the best song of mine that Dean recorded he liked it too I was at the session and arranger Ernie Freeman put these horn licks after each line sings the cliched horn part and I just thought Oh man this is ruining it If he could only have put some nice Floyd Cramer type piano fills in there instead of those horns You know not to ham it up I was just cringing but I couldn t say anything I really think the song would ve had some notoriety if it was done without the horn licks But Ernie was a great arranger That s just my own thoughts on that one And Not Enough Indians was definitely about my marriage Dean got a kick out of that song You could tell when he was singing it That war whoop at the end of the song was an original ad lib on Dean s part You wrote three tracks on Dean s I Take A Lot Of Pride In What I Am LP One Cup Of Happiness And One Piece Of Mind was spelled piece on the record jacket but peace on both the and album labels Which one is correct and also was the song based on any particular event in your life Well it had the double meaning of piece peace when I did it but I wrote it as piece I can t remember any specific incident But as a writer you ve always got to have your antennae up If You Ever Get Around To Loving Me was one of my favorites it was a warm song And on The Sneaky Little Side Of Me I was just trying to work into his personality and write something that he might like He had done a couple other things kinda like that you know playing the field I thought that there might be a sneaky side of him who knows laughter The final tune of yours that Dean recorded was The Right Kind Of Woman Of all the songs I wrote for him I thought that was the biggest clunker The night that was recorded Dean had agreed to let some people come in to the studio and watch him There was sort of an audience there my wife people from Bowen s office and people that I knew And Dean was having a little trouble getting the song And I m just sitting over there sweating cause I knew that the song wasn t that good So Bowen went over and straightened out whatever problem it was that Dean was having with it He Bowen was just about to can it and I think they didn t because some of the people there had come to cheer me on I think Bowen was really trying to give me a helping hand But I still have to pull the covers over my head when I hear that song According to the Warner Brothers Archives Dean also recorded two of your songs at Hollywood Sound that were never released What can you tell me about Do You Think It s Time Well I remember the song sings I think it s time we try again Yeah that was a good one How About I Can Remember Oh that was one of my favorite tunes I think I submitted those songs for him But I m really skeptical about that session information I think they the Warner Brothers archives might ve gotten some of the demos that I did for Dean mixed up with his actual recordings Author s note Baker is correct As the recently released Bear Family box set illustrates the August session long thought to be unreleased Dino tracks are actually Baker s demos for Dean You mentioned that you attended Dean s recording sessions What were they like Dean was really a pro It only took him two days to record an album In the afternoon Bowen would bring the band in And the orchestra and background singers would go down every song he was gonna record that night So they would have it pretty well polished and ready to go before Dean ever walked in He d come in about eight at night and park his Aston Martin in front of the door He d do one or two takes and he was out of there It was a very smart way to record Bowen would have to pay for double sessions for everybody but it worked Dean never gave more than two or three takes He d just lay it right down It wasn t like most other sessions where you hear the arrangement on the spot and the singer gets used to it and then they all do it together Since the band was already rehearsed that was a big plus for everybody I remember Bowen would get out there right in the middle of the room and and slam his foot on the floor for the downbeat and count One Two Three I used to get a kick out of that He d shake that whole damn orchestra up in no time Finally is there anything else about working with Dean that you d like to mention He was always very nice to me I never saw him the slightest bit inebriated He was always dressed immaculately like he stepped off a magazine ad or something And he had these loafer like shoes kinda like slippers They were black velvet with a gold red and black crest on them And I was really impressed with his Aston Martin they were way up there cost wise even in those days He was really one hell of a guy Special thanks to Dean Martin historian and author John Chintala Special Thanks to Baker Knight who s incredible talent continues to brighten our lives everyday copy Copyright Dean Martin Fan

'BAKER Genealogy BAKER FAMILY HISTORY GENEALOGY From A Genealogical Record of the Moses Baker Family In Dorothy Merrifield wrote a book entitled A Genealogical Record of the Moses Baker Family This book is no longer in print therefore for the benefit of descendants of Moses Baker in their quest to find information on this family I will attempt to include a small part of the book on this web page The book is pages long and I am in possession of photocopies of only a portion of this book The book is no longer in print If you have any information to add to the information below please contact me at CMElaine aol com Thanks Elaine Powell The introduction of the book reads as follows Much has been written about the early Bakers of Nansemond Isle of Wight and Surry Counties Virginia and of Gates Chowan and Bertie Counties North Carolina John Bennett Boddie in his books Southside Virginia Families Vol Virginia Historical Genealogies and Seventeenth Century Isle of Wight County Virginia has devoted many pages to the families of Lawrence and Henry Baker Bodie suggest that the Bakers were from Sussex and Kent England and that they first settled in Virginia in the early seventeenth century Lawrence Baker was granted land in Surry County Virginia in He was a member of the House of Burgesses from to He died in and left his estate to his widow Elizabeth and his daughter Catherine who was the wife of Arthur Allen Boddie SS p A Henry Baker was also a resident of Surry and he patented land in He died in leaving his estate to his wife Sarah and his children His daughters were Rebecca Mary Susan and Elizabeth His sons were Henry Edward and William Boddie doesn t attempt to establish a proven relationship between Lawrence Baker and Henry Baker but it is very likely that they were either brothers or father and son Ibid Boddie continues with the family of Henry Baker of Isle of Wight County Virginia He suggests that Henry of Isle of Wight may have been the son of Henry who died in Surry County Virginia in Boddie believed that Mary Baker Henry s wife was a daughter of John Blake of Nansemond County Virginia but in the year Ex Judge B B Winborne a descendant of Henry Baker wrote an article about this family which was published in the summer issue of the North Carolina Genealogy pp and it was his belief that Henry Baker married Mary Bennett one of the daughters of Edward Bennett of Isle of Wight County Virginia Edward Bennett had another daughter named Sylvester or Sylvestra who married Major Nicholas Hill Henry Baker was a wealthy merchant and when he died in he left a large estate to his wife and children The names of his children were Henry James Lawrence William Sarah Mary Catherine and Elizabeth The land that he devised to his sons Henry William and Lawrence fell within the boundaries of Chowan Precinct North Carolina and when Hertford County was established their lands were within the boundaries of Hertford County North Carolina NCG pp For more information about this early and very interesting family the reader is referred to the books mentioned below This book is about the family of Moses Baker A Moses Baker died in Isle of Wight County Virginia prior to His widow Elizabeth married Edward Riddle Moses Baker had at least one son Moses Baker Jr In Moses Baker Jr sued his stepfather Edward Riddle for the estate that his father Moses Baker Sr had devised to him in his last Will and Testament A few months later Edward and Elizabeth Riddle died and letters of administration were granted to Samuel Rollyson who had married Hannah Baker one of Elizabeth s daughters An attachment was awarded to Moses Baker Jr against Samuel Rollyson for many valuable articles which had belonged to Moses Baker Sr In one of his declarations Moses Baker Jr stated that he was the godson of Colonel John Powell and he also sued to recover the property devised to him by the last Will and Testament of Colonel Powell Boddie IW p and VHG p The next reference to Moses Baker was his marriage to Elizabeth Brown on January in Elizabeth City Virginia Thirty years later he died His Will is recorded in Chowan County North Carolina He left a wife three sons and three daughters The following is an excerpt from his Will Being very sick and weak in body but of perfect mind and memory I bequeath unto my well beloved wife all my estate during her natural life or widowhood only to my three daughters the cattal which are called theirs at the day of marrige to my son Moses my niegar fallows to my son Benett my gun and belt to my son William one cow and cow calf at the age of also a bed the rest of my estate to be divided after my debts are paid my friend Richard Minshen and my wife my whole and sole executors Wit Aaron Blanchard Jurat William Hill and William x Wesson Jurat Chowan January Court NCA WB p Please keep in mind the names of the witnesses to Moses Baker s Will Notice that Moses Baker named his second son Benett As stated on the beginning page of this introduction Mary Bennett married Henry Baker and Mary s sister Sylvester Bennett married Major Nicholas Hill A Moses Hill died very early in Chowan County North Carolina and left a Will but it was said to be illegible Grimes p William Weston who was one of the witnesses to Moses Baker s Will was married to Catherine Blanchard daughter of Benjamin Blanchard An excerpt from the Will of Benjamin Blanchard follows Upper part of Nansemond County June Benjamin Blanchard Sons Robert Land on Beverdam Sw in Chowan Precinct N C Absalom Benjamin Land on Beverdam Son in law William Weston wife Catherine Executors Wife Catherine and son Robert Wits William Hill James Grising Thomas Roundtree Grimes p William Hill also a witness to Moses Baker s Will married Mary Spivey a daughter of Thomas Spivey William Weston and Robert Blanchard witnessed Spevey s Will Mark Chapel was a legatee of Thomas Spivey Grimes p A Richard Hill died and left a Will in Craven County North Carolina in His heirs were Daughter Ann Jones son in law Evan Jones granddaughter Elizabeth Hill Exr Brother Francis Hill Grimes p On page four of this book please note that Margaret daughter of Michael Baker married a man named Evan Jones This Evan Jones was no doubt a grandson or grandnephew of the Evan Jones mentioned in the Will of Richard Hill In Moses Baker was the executor of the Will of Richard Chappell It is assumed that this Moses Baker was the son mentioned in the Will of the Moses Baker who died in Chowan County North Carolina in An Excerpt from the Will of Richard Chappell follows Chowan County N C March Pro Oct Richad Chappel s Will suggests a close family relationship He may have been the brother of Eliza Chappell We know that Moses Baker married Elizabeth Brown in in Elizabeth City Virginia and that he died in in Chowan County mentioning three unnamed daughters in his Will Eliza may have been one of those Richard Chappell named his eldest son Moses probably after Moses Baker Since Richard Chappell didn t appoint his son Moses as his executor it may be that he wasn t of legal age Below are abstracts of two deeds involving Moses and Bennett Baker DB C p Bertie Co N C Jan Moses Baker Yeoman sold to Benjamin Holleman acres for pounds land on the east side of Chinkapin Creek adjoining John Smith at Flatt Sw and Kellum Wits John Wynns John Smith W Evens May Ct BD C p Bertie Co N C May John Smith yeoman sold to Bennett Baker miller acres for pounds on the East side of Chinkapin Sw adjoining land of James Holley bequeathed to Jane his wife by the last Will and Testament of our father John Smith Deceased Adjoining James Williams Wits John Wynns John Freeman Thomas Parker Bell pp and These two deeds prove that Moses and Bennett Baker sons of Moses Baker of Chowan County North Carolina owned land adjacent to each other on Chinkapin Creek in Bertie County which later was in Hertford County when that County was organised They lived in the same County as Henry and Lawrence Baker and were neighbors to James Williams Moses Bake sold his land and moved to Edgecombe County North Carolina In he witnessed the Will of George Williams An excerpt of that Will follows Edgecombe Co N C July Pro June Will of George Williams Sons George Samuel Dau Cloe Dec d sister Lucretia Williams Extrix Wife Priscilla Wit George Crudup Moses Baker and John Norwood Grimes p Moses Baker who died in Edgecombe County North Carolina in and who was the progenitor of our family named his eldest son Michael perhaps after Michael Brinkley who witnessed the Will of Richard Chappell He named his second son Aaron after Aaron Blanchard who witnessed the Will of Moses Baker who died in in Chowan County His fourth son Thomas married Penelope Williams who was the daughter of Thomas and Margaret Williams Thomas and Margaret Williams also had a daughter named Priscilla She may have been named after the wife of George Williams Watson N C Estate Records All through the genealogy that follows you will find the names of Smith Williams and Jones the same family names associated with Moses Baker in Bertie and Edgecombe Counties North Carolina Although Henry Baker and Lawrence Baker lived in the same general area as Moses Baker in Chowan Bertie and Hertford Counties of North Carolina I have not found any evidence that they were related unless the relationship occurred in the early s in Nansemond and Isle of Wight Counties Virginia There seems to be no similarities of names carried on by the two families Although I believe that Moses Baker who died in Edgecombe County North Carolina is a descendant of Moses Baker who died in Chowan County North Carolina in despite all of the evidence however interesting I have been unable to prove a direct relationship Therefore I begin A Genealogical Record of the Moses Baker Family with Moses Baker of Edgecombe County North Carolina Dorothy Merrifield THE FIRST GENERATION MOSES BAKER was born ca probably in Virginia and he died in in Edgecombe County North Carolina He wife s name was Sarah and on October she testified in Court that she had received her share of her deceased husband s estate from Jesse Baker the executor BD p Moses Baker had formerly lived in Bertie County North Carolina on Chinquapin Creek sometimes called Chinkapin His brother Bennett Baker lived next door Chinquapin Creek was a branch of the Chowan River which was the dividing line between Bertie and Chowan Counties When Hertford County was formed in Chinquapin Creek was in that County Other Bakers living in the area were William Baker and his two sons William Jr and James Benjamin Baker Henry Baker and Blake Baker Bell pp Moses sold his land in Bertie County in and he moved to Edgecombe County North Carolina SOMETIME BETWEEN AND MOSES BAKER AND HIS SON MOSES BAKER JR SERVED IN THE MILITIA IN THE COMPANY COMMANDED BY CAPTAIN SOLOMON ALSTON Captain Alston s Company guarded the soother area of Edgecombe County that later was cut off to form the northeast part of Wilson County in Hugh Johnston In Meady Bozeman deeded one acre of land to the Protestant Ana Baptist Church on Town Creek Town Creek branched off of Sw Creek a branch of the Tar River Moses Baker was a member and a trustee of the church Other trustees were Miles Scarbory John Stokes William Scarbory and James Scarbory Witnesses to the deed were Malachi Mounts and Jesse Drake DB p Edge Co N C I have estimated the birthdates of Moses Baker and his children in this way Michael Baker the eldest son of Moses Baker died in and he was the father of ten living children Two of his sons were of legal age when he died as he appointed them executors of his Will That means that they were born before Subtract twenty one years from and we have the approximate date of Michael s birth which would be about Thomas Baker the fourth son of Moses Baker was married January to Penelope Williams If he was twenty one years old or older when he married then he would have been born about Jesse Baker the youngest son of Moses was married and the father of four sons when his father died in His eldest son was born in That would place Jesse Baker

'Christine Otis Baker D over P ublic L ibrary Locust St Dover NH Mon Wed Thur Fri Sat Sun Search our Catalog Home Children s Room Historical Photographs Christine Otis Baker By John Scales Christine Otis who married Capt Thomas Baker of Deerfield Massachusetts in was born in Dover March in her father s garrisoned house which stood on the north side of where is now Milk Street about half way between Central Avenue and Mt Vernon Street She was the daughter of Richard Otis Esq and his second wife Grizel Warren daughter of James and Margaret Warren of Kittery Maine The Otises and Warrens have an excellent ancestral record but I will not stop to give it here When her father s garrison was burned and he was killed on June Christine was an infant and was taken prisoner with her mother to Canada by the Indians as were also her half sister Rose and her half brothers Stephen and John October Christine s mother having been converted to the Romish faith was married to a Frenchman named Philip Robitaile and never returned to New England dying in Montreal at the great age of years Her daughter had been baptized in the First Church at Dover by the pastor Rev John Pike as Margaret Otis but when her mother joined the Roman Catholic Church and married a Frenchman the priest rebaptized the daughter and gave her the name Christine which name she retained to the end of her life although good Parson Stoddard of Dover baptized her again when she returned and married Capt Thomas Baker in and gave her the old name Margaret In Montreal she was placed in a nunnery and educated in the Romish faith until she was years old They tried to induce her to become a nun and take the veils of the church but she would not be persuaded then they compelled her to marry a Frenchman named La Beau June the recode of her marriage is on file in Montreal As the education of women went she was well educated She and her husband lived together about years and then he died leaving her with two or three children The first that she saw of Thomas Baker was in the year she married the Frenchman Baker had been brought to Montreal a prisoner from Deerfield Massachusetts He was a frisky young fellow and tried to escape the guard caught him and he was about to be shot a Frenchman intervened and paid a suitable ransom to save his life and permit him to return to his home in Massachusetts Somehow during the affair which of course made a great commotion among the inhabitants both French and English Christine Otis Le Beau made the acquaintance of the young man and gave him her sympathy and probably expressed her admiration for his courage in attempting to escape It may have been her husband who paid the sum for Baker a ransom Anyway they became close friends then and did not forget it in the seven years that followed Thomas Baker returned home and in time became a Captain and won fame in the public service Christine remained in Canada and in the course of seven years became the mother of three children and a handsome widow of twenty five years Then it came to pass that Thomas and Christine met again and under circumstances entirely difference from those under which they had parted in Massachusetts sent a commission to Canada in to arrange for ransoming the English prisoners there Major John Stoddard being at the head of it and Captain Thomas Baker a member being famous now from his leadership of the Indian c aign in the White Mountain region in which he secured the scalp of the famous Indian Sachem Wattanummom and by the deed perpetuated his name forever in Baker River which joins the Pemegewasstt north of Plymouth New H shire It was near the junction of these rivers that the battle with the Indians took place Moreover besides having the river named for him the General Court of Massachusetts gave Baker a reward of summa cum laude Captain Baker with the rest of the Commissioners was in Montreal in March they met the prisoners and the officials and commenced negotiations It does not come within the scope of my paper to speak further of the negotiations than to say that Christine Otis Le Beau then and there met Captain Thomas Baker She was a handsome widow of twenty five yeas in the bloom of health sparkling with wit and womanly attractions he was a bachelor a few years older tall stalwart and handsome in his military bearing After they met and exchanged the usual formalities of such and occasion she resolved in her own mind to return to New England he resolved in his mind to rescue that handsome widow from the thralls of popery and the hated and detested Frenchmen Thus matters stood for awhile negotiations made slow progress The French would not consent for her to go if she went she must leave her children and lose all of her property She attempted to smuggle her personal property into a boat to carry them to Quebec the French priests discovered her work and took everything from the boat About this time in the negotiation Capt Baker was ordered by Major Stoddard to return to Boston and report progress and ask for further instructions He attended to these duties and returned The French continued as obstinate as ever in their refusal to let the captives go The Caption and the widow held a council of war she decided to leave her children and all her property except her wearing apparel and what she could carry in her hands They secretly embarked on a boat and started on the voyage to Quebec where Major Stoddard and other Commissioners were then stationed Just imagine that trip of miles in an ordinary boat Talk about romance Why romance pales before the true story of the heroism of this woman who so loved Old Dover which she had seen only as a babe and so loved the gallant captain that she forsook all and trusted her life and her fortune to his care It is easy enough to look back over years but what a struggle it must have been for her to look ahead sixty years Major Stoddard chronicles their arrival at Quebec in the summer of later they sailed with others for Boston where they arrived September of that year From Boston she accompanied the Captain to Deerfield and good Parson Stoddard took her in hand and soon made a good protestant of her He rebaptized her with her baby name Margaret and took her into the church The townspeople became interested in her welfare and enthusiastic in the praise of her noble qualities December the town granted her a valuable lot of land on the condition that she marry Capt Thomas Baker She accepted the land and the conditions They were married in and set up housekeeping and farming in Deerfield they remained there two years leading a peaceful quiet and happy life Their first child was born June in due time Parson Stoddard christened it Christine having previously baptized the mother by her baby name of Margaret In they removed from Deerfield to Brookfield where they resided on their farm until In she made a trip to Canada with the object in view of getting her French children and bringing them to New England Her efforts were unsuccessful The Romish priests would not permit her to see them much less bring them away on the other hand they tried to persuade her to stay there She would not listen to them and so returned grieved in heart but determined in spirit The women are few who could have endured what she did and not yield to the wily talk of the priests In Capt Baker was elected Representative at the General Court of Massachusetts by the freemen of Brookfield being the first to serve that town He served his town in that and various capacities honorably and ably during the next ten years It was in this town that most of their children were born one of whom became one of Dover s most distinguished men Col Otis Baker In Christine received a letter from the prelate who had been her priest in Canada in which he urged her to return there and reunited with the Romish Church presenting many theological reasons why he thought she ought to do so Instead of returning to Canada she turned the letter over to Gov Burnet and he wrote an elaborate answer to the theological statements of the priest both the letter and the Governor s answer are in print in the Massachusetts archives of that period The Governor had the best of the argument as you all can see by reading the letter and the answer The Kanuc priest never ventured a reply nor made further endeavors to get her back to Canada In they sold their Brookfield property which was a comfortable estate to a speculator who in some way cheated them out of the whole amount of the sale and left Capt Baker and his family in very straightened circumstances They lived awhile at Mendon and next at Newport Rhode Island On account of the high standing of Captain Baker and his wife the general court of Massachusetts very generously aided them to help them recover their fortunes The Court was furthermore inclined to do this as Captain Baker s health had given out so that he could not do any hard work that required manual exertion The Court granted Christine acres of valuable land in York County Maine She sold this land for a handsome sum of money with which she built a house in Dover to which they removed in This house stood at the corner of Silver Street and Central Avenue where now is the brick block After she had built and furnished it she petitioned the general court of New H shire for a license to keep a public house which petition can be found in the unpublished Provincial Papers of New H shire Here she kept a public house for many years and prospered in her business affairs although her husband was an invalid all the rest of his years until his death in while on a visit to friends in Roxbury Massachusetts The record says he died of the lethargy which I supposed the doctors in the twentieth century would call apoplexy Christine died February aged years and her remains were interred in the Col Baker burial lot on Pine Hill I know not whether the spot can now be found be that as it may a marker of some kind ought to be placed near the spot if not on her grave so that future generations may know and honor the spot Her record in Dover is of the best Her house was a model of neatness comfort and good cooking When the Royal Governors passed through Dover they honored themselves by calling at her tavern they always left with a feeling of good cheer and the highest respect for their hostess May she united with the First Church Parson Cushing being pastor She remained a devout member of this organization to the end of her life during her last few years she was an invalid but all her wants were kindly administered to by her son Col Otis Baker and his family Rev Dr Belknap who was then pastor gave her that spiritual consolation which her four score years must have made her greatly enjoy and when she closed her eyelids forever at four score and five he performed the last sad rites over her remains Her son Col Otis Baker lived in a house that he built several years before the Revolution where the Whidden house now stands at the corner of Silver and Atkinson streets Of course then Atkinson Street did not exist and Silver Street was simply the Barrington Road It was in this house that Christine Baker passed her old age Dr Belknap was her next door neighbor living where now is the Belknap School House Several members of this Society are relatives of her all of the Baker family in Dover are her descendants Her career as a whole is undoubtedly the most remarkable of any Dover woman previous to the Revolution Dover People in the past have been inclined to make too little account of heir heroes and heroines while they looked up to those in Massachusetts because great writers and lecturers and Boston newspapers have for a hundred years continually talked about them and their great deeds Even the heroine Mrs Baker is rarely spoken of by Massachusetts writers as a Dover woman though forty years of her life were passed here and here her distinguished son and grandson lived and their worthy descendants Her husband Capt Thomas Baker seems not to have taken an active part in public affairs after he came to Dover He was broken in health before coming here and appears to have been an invalid during the nearly twenty years he lived here coming in and dying in He assisted his wife in running the tavern but from the first it was her tavern not his His record during his vigorous years is that of an active and honorable man and he was held in high esteem by the authorities in Massachusetts as was also his wife There ought to be a marker placed on the brick block at the corner of Silver Street and Central Avenue designating that as the spot where Christine Otis Baker kept a tavern The reason she had to petition the General Court to grant her a license to keep a public house is supposed to be that the Selectmen of the town refused to grant it because they favored the proprietors of the old Dover Hotel You see the officials of Dover one hundred and seventy years ago were not so much superior to those of the modern city they were afraid Mrs Baker would hurt the business of old resident But the General Court gave her the required license and she kept a first class old fashioned tavern This historical essay is provided free to all readers as an educational service It may not be reproduced on

Beaufort which she did inherit from her mother then Marchioness of Winchester and Thomas had led average lives for children of their era and station and had also survived the third sibling a second daughter who passed on at an early age His education went as planned as his father would say where upon at the age of fifteen he was had been educated out of Hart Hall in Oxford Two years later in at the age of seventeen he left his childhood home and took residence in London where he began pursuing his life as a poet and playwright He received the bulk his wealth from his father Sir Richard Sackville a wealthy landowner whose acquisitiveness earned him the nickname of Fill Sack and was noted for reasons of his great wealth and vast patrimony H e continue to live in such a manner as his father did knowing how to spend his moneys well and in such a way that he and his family could live in a comfortable fashion At nineteen years of age in he met fell in love with and married the daughter of a member of the Privy Council under Queen Mary Cicely Baker of Kent His father s exclusion from office under Mary did not significantly delay Thomas Sackville s entry upon public life for it was not long after his coming of age that he sat in his first Parliament His election at the beginning of for East Grinstead where his father had wielded great influence had the appearance of a safeguard against his failing to carry off the knighthood for Westmoreland after he had done so and entered the House as junior knight for that shire the vacancy at East Grinstead was filled by another Sackville nominee Thomas Farnham The circumstances of Sackville s election for Westmoreland are not made easier of explanation by the damaged state of the return on which the surname is represented only by the fragment sa A century ago the name was read as salkeld The accuracy of this reading is borne out by the appearance of that name afterwards erased and replaced by sackvell on one of the two remaining copies of the Crown Office list the other and later copy has sackveld alone It is thus possible that a Thomas Salkeld presumably of the prominent Westmoreland family of that name was elected but was afterwards superseded by Sackville What is more likely however is that Sackville was elected and that instead of his unfamiliar name its near counterpart was entered on the return to be copied on the Crown Office list and only corrected when Sackville appeared in the House Who procured his election is a matter of speculation Neither he nor his fellow knight Anthony Kempe another Sussex man had any standing in Westmoreland but both could claim a marriage connection with Henry Clifford Earl of Cumberland hereditary sheriff of the county and with his father in law the rd Lord Dacre of Gillesland Cumberland must also have had dealings with both Sackville s father and ex chancellor or augmentations and his father in law Sir John Baker one of whom doubtless made the approach For Sackville as for Kempe a knighthood of the shire was not to recur he was to sit as a burgess in the first two Elizabethan Parliaments and in the third he took his seat in the Lords Sackville had appeared on the pardon roll in Oct as of London On Mar together with Thomas Swynton he purchased various properties in Kent and Sussex for In co operation with Thomas Norton he wrote The Tragedie of Gorboduc but he handed over his other literary project A myrroure for magistrates to George Ferrers and William Baldwin after completing the Introduction In upon the death of Queen Mary her half sister Elizabeth Tudor third cousin on her mother Anne Boleyn s side ascended England s throne In addition during the year of he received the title of Grandmaster of the Order of Freemasons In he was once again elected to Parliament this time for Aylesbury When he became thirty one years of age he was knighted and raised to peerage as Lord Buckhurst which did take place on the eighth day of Jun of that year One year prior to receiving the title of Lord Buckhurst Queen Elizabeth awarded a piece of property to keeping known as Knole Much of the fabric of Knole dates from the second half of the fifteenth century On Jun William Fiennes sold the estate s d to Thomas Bourchier Archbishop of Canterbury and for a brief period in Lord Chancellor of England Between that date and his death in Bourchier built himself a substantial but relatively austere palace grouped around a series of courtyards and containing all of the elements that one would expect to see in the house of an important medieval prelate a great hall with a day parlour and first floor solar at one end and kitchens and domestic offices at the other a chapel and lodgings for his large household When Bourchier died at Knole he left the estate to the See of Canterbury and it functioned as an archiepiscopal palace until when Henry VIII bullied Thomas Cranmer into presenting it to the Crown The King considerably enlarged the house by building three new ranges of lodgings and a turreted and crenellated gatehouse in the front of the Archbishop s original gatehouse thus forming what is now known as the Green Court the main entrance court at Knole After his death the house went through a rather confused series of occupancies Edward VI assigned it to John Dudley Duke of Northumberland who for some reason returned it two years later Mary he granted it to Cardinal Pole for life in when he died in Nov on the same day as the Queen it reverted to the Crown Elizabeth granted it to John Dudley s son Robert Earl of Leicester who promptly sublet it before returning it still sublet in In Jun the Queen presented the estate to his keeping under whom Knole has finally settled down to a more stable period of ownership But throughout his career as one of her Majesty s chief advisers he had been unable to even live at Knole in the stead he had managed replace the old Archbishop s palace with a Theobalds or a Holdenby for his Queen s entertainment Although he had been granted the house and estate in it currently occupied by the Lennard family tenants who had moved in as the Earl of Leicester handed the property back to the Crown In he had been commissioned to traveled to France on an official visit his mission was to persuaded the Queen Mother to make a motion for the marriage of Elizabeth with her second son the Duke of Anjou In at the age of thirty three years old he was honoured to be placed in the office of Lord Lieutenant of Sussex Two years later in he returned to France to congratulate Charles IX on his marriage afterwhich he did return to England bringing Paul du Foix along to continue the discussion of the impending marriage Also within that year he had been bestowed a Master of Arts from Cambridge In he became a member of her Majesty s Privy Council and became employed as Commissioner at state trials As a member of her Majesty s Privy Council he was considered a prot g e of William Cecil Baron Burghley and he tends to agree with most of the issues Burghley is in favor of His career took Sackville to the treasurership and an Earldom before he died at the council table on

University Park PA Phone FAX Email tcb psu edu Current Graduate Students Jon Lelito Education B S Entomology Cornell University M S Entomology Cornell University Ph D Entomology Michigan State University International Programs Experience Councilor for the Asia Pacific Association of Chemical Ecologists Research Focus Areas Insect Pheromones and Odor Mediated Behavior Neuroethological Studies of Olfaction Identification and Development of Insect Attractants for IPM Systems Development of Olfaction Based Biosensors Research Programs Interests Neuroethological studies of heliothine moth sex pheromone and host plant volatile mixture interactions One long term research project that my lab has been involved in with funding from the USDA NRI and from NSF has been to understand insect olfaction using a comparative approach involving heliothine moth species and their sex pheromone communication systems We perform wind tunnel experiments to understand how sex pheromone blend alterations affect moth upwind flight behavior We compare the behavioral results to single cell recordings from antennal receptor neurons In addition we backfill the neurons with cobalt dye to stain the olfactory pathways themselves and see where they project to in the antennal lobe of the brain Recently we found an unexpected interaction between pheromone components and floral odors that points to an increased role of antennal neurons in processing odor mixtures before being sent to higher analysis centers Research and development of a discriminating insect antenna based olfactory biosensor My laboratory has been working on a project over the past six years or so funded first by DARPA for four years to develop a highly sensitive tissue based biosensor that can detect discriminate and locate agents of harm such as unexploded land mines and other ordinance drugs and toxins Our biosensor called the Quadro Probe uses an array of insect antennae that reports differential patterns of excitation when placed in the odor plumes emanating from different types of odor sources many tens of meters upwind What is exciting about this biosensor is not only in its potential for detecting and locating agents of harm but also in what it is revealing to us about odor plumes and insects olfactory capabilities A computer algorithm developed in conjunction with collaborators at the University of Illinois Chicago now allows the biosensor to perform its odor discriminating feats in real time After an initial training session of approximately seconds the biosensor s probe placed in odor plumes coupled with the algorithm all operating in real time has been shown to recognize individual odor strands in the plume as a specific odor with correct signal identification Development of effective novel insect attractants traps and mating disruption dispensers For a long time now our lab s philosophy has been that the land grant university mission requires that agricultural experiment station researchers such as ourselves work to deliver useful technologies and information to the people of our state Thus one major element of my lab s research continues to be to try to isolate and identify useful new attractants and other behavior modifying chemicals and help develop them into technologies that are available in the marketplace Our work over the past years or so along these lines has resulted in a novel housefly attractant a new Drosophila fruit fly attractant and a new lacewing and ladybeetle attractant that are being or have been developed into new commercial products for use in and around the home In addition we have developed and commercialized four new mating disruptant formulations for use against the European cornborer oriental fruit moth and two moth pests of cranberry respectively These products are all listed as acceptable for use in organic practice by the Organic Materials Review Institute Relevant Publications Ochieng S A K Poole W L Roelofs N J

Thomas Calloway was buried there His grave is marked with a rough stone shaft with letters T C chiseled on it by Daniel Boone From The Beginnings of the Calloway Family page He settled in Halifax Co VA in He was an Ensign then a Captain in the Colonial troops from Halifax Co VA in the French and Indian War the fact that he had previously become an Indian trader probably brought about his military promotions The same may be said concerning his brothers Colonel Richard Calloway and Colonel William Calloway In the Indians were very troublesome At this time the three brothers were called upon to go into active service with their volunteer companies The Black Water Fort was assigned to Richard Calloway the Pig River Fort to William Calloway and Hickory s Fort to Thomas Calloway For a period of three years these three Calloway brothers guarded the frontier of nearly fifty miles They always discovered the Indians first fired among them and made them scatter like wolves In the french Indian War had begun and Captain Thomas Calloway served under the command of George Washington during the conflict After the French and Indian War Thomas Calloway resigned his commission as a military officer and returned to private life Pittslvania Co VA had been formed prior to this time for he had served as appointment as high sheriff of that county after He owned thousands of acres of land there but was crowded out by a company of men who had land warrants that over lapped some of his holdings The King and parliament favored those of great wealth so it was useless for an individual in moderate circumstances to make an appeal For this reason he sold off the rest of his land and emigrated to Surry Co NC in and settled on a branch of the Yadkin river This was the spring of the Great May Frost On May the frost was so heavy that no one had ever seen a frost like it at that time of year the frost was so severe that all vegetation that had life was struck dead Thomas Calloway hesitated at first to take part in the war Revolutionary War He could hardly think of separating from the Mother Country He hoped for reconciliation after the Battle of Lexington of April and until the Battle of Bunker Hill June at which time George Washington took command He Calloway had taken many commissions under the King s authority and this fact involved an oath of true loyalty to the crown of Great Britian A p hlet by Samuel Adams convinced Captain Calloway that the King himself had become a rebel in that he no longer protected his subjects but that he had sent fleets and an army here to kill and destroy us and that several acts of parliament had declared us out of his protection He instantly declared himself a Bostonian a title used by people later known as Whigs and he his sons and sons in law volunteered in to defend their country this was when he was seventy six years of age and was too old to command forces So they gave him an honorable discharge Colonel Cleveland is said to have told him he ought to charge the army with everything they used observing that the individual could not hurt the public but the public could soon ruin the individual but he Thomas Calloway

for William Callaway From Callaway Family Association Journal page DR DRAPER s ACCOUNT In his Kings Mountain and Its Heroes Dr Draper tells us Ch p et seq that the Old Fields belonged to Colonel Cleveland and served in peaceful times as a grazing region for his stock and there his tenant Jesse Duncan resided On Saturday April accompanied only by a negro servant Cleveland rode from his Round About plantation on the Yadkin to the Old Fields where he spent the night Captain William Riddle a son of Col James Riddle of Surry county both of whom were Royalists was at that time approaching Old Field from Virginia with Captain Ross a Whig captive and his servant enroute to Ninety Six in South Carolina Captain Riddle s party of six or eight men reached the home of Benjamin Cutbirth some four miles above Old Field on the afternoon of the day that Cleveland arrived at Jesse Duncan s and abused Cutbirth who was a Whig and suffering from wounds he had but recently sustained in the American cause Riddle however soon left Cutbirth s and went on to the upper end of Old Fields where Joseph and Timothy Perkins resided about one mile above Duncan s Both these men were absent in Tory service at the time but Riddle learned from their women that Cleveland was at Duncan s with only his servant Duncan and one or two of the Calloway family Riddle however was afraid to attack Cleveland openly and determined to lure him into an ambush the next morning Accordingly that night he had Cleveland s horses secretly taken from Duncan s to a laurel thicket just above the Perkins house where they were tried and left But it so happened that on that very Saturday Richard Calloway and his brother in law John Shirley went down from the neighboring residence of Thomas Calloway to see Col Cleveland where they remained over night On the following Sunday morning discovering that his horses were missing Cleveland and Duncan each with a pistol and Calloway and Shirley unarmed went in pursuit following the tracks of the stolen horses just as Riddle had planned Reaching the Perkins place one of the Perkins women knowing of the ambuscade secretly desired to save the Colonel from his impending fate and detained him as long as she could while his three companions went on Cleveland following some little distance behind She also followed retarding Cleveland by enquiries until his companions had crossed the fence that adjoined the thicket where they were fired upon by Riddle s men from their places of concealment Calloway s thigh was broken by the shot of Zachariah Wells but Duncan and Shirley escaped Cleveland dodged into the house with several Tories at his heels There he surrendered on condition that they would spare his life but when Wells arrived he swore that he would kill Cleveland then and there and would have done so had not the latter seized Abigal Walters and kept her between him and his would be assassin Riddle however soon came upon the scene and ordered Wells to desist after which the whole party with their prisoner and his servant were speedily mounted and hurried up New river traveling mostly in its bed to avoid being tracked in case of pursuit Two boys of fourteen and fifteen Daniel Cutbirth and a youth named Walters had resolved to waylay Riddle on his return to Benjamin Cutbirth s and rescue whatever prisoners he might have with him but they were deterred from their purpose by the size and noise of Riddle s party as they passed their place of concealment that Sunday morning Riddle s party got dinner at Benjamin Cutbirth s where one of Cutbirth s daughters was abused and kicked by Riddle because of her reluctance in serving Riddle s party After dinner Riddle s party proceeded up the bed of New river to the mouth of Elk creek where the new and promising town of Todd now flourishes at the terminus of a new railroad now building from Konarok Va Cleveland meanwhile breaking off overhanging twigs and dropping them in the stream as a guide to his friends who he knew would soon follow in pursuit From the head of the south fork of Elk they ascended up the mountains in what has since been known as Riddle s Knob in what is now Watauga county and some fourteen miles from the place of Cleveland s captivity where they c ed for the night Meantime early that Sabbath morning Joseph Calloway and his brother in law Berry Toney had called at Duncan s and hearing firing in the direction of Perkins s home hastened there but meeting Duncan and Shirley in rapid flight they learned from them that Richard Calloway had been left behind for dead and that Cleveland was either dead or captured Duncan Shirley and Toney then went to notify the people of the scattered settlements to meet that afternoon at the Old Fields while Joseph Calloway rode to Captain Robert Cleveland s place on Lewis Fork of the Yadkin river a dozen miles distant His brother William Calloway started forthwith up New river and soon came across Benjamin Greer and Samuel McQueen who readily joined them and together they followed Riddle s trail till night overtook them ten miles above the Old Fields where Calloway and McQueen remained while Greer returned to pilot whatever men might have gathered to engage in the pursuit of the Tories Greer soon met Robert Cleveland and twenty others at the Old Fields and all started at once reaching Calloway and McQueen before day Monday morning John Baker joined Calloway and McQueen to lead the advance as spies or advance guards and soon after sunrise the nine men who were in advance of the others fired upon Riddle s party while Cleveland tumbled behind the log on which he was slowly writing passes for his Tory captors But Wells alone was shot being hit as he sc ered away by William Calloway and was left as it was supposed that he had been mortally wounded Riddle and his wife mounted horses and escaped with the others of his band Cleveland s servant who had been a pack horse for the Tory plunderers was rescued his master Captain Ross Riddle s Virginia prisoner was rescued Shortly after this Riddle captured on Kings creek at night two of Cleveland s noted soldiers David and

birth of John Renta Baker in to the birth of Andy Baker in England It does not seem prudent for me to try to duplicate what has already been done What I will do as I enter this data through these six

Jean Vore To BBrown aol com BBrown aol com Here is the Gist of the article The article was found a book published by the Tennessee Historical and Genealogical Society The article goes The first known ancestor of the Bakers of Hancock County was Robert I of England Who was the King s personal Knight at the round table The king gave him his daughter as his wife and many riches and bestowed him with a coat of arms The Coat of Arms consisted of the castle with three roses in the yard The article goes on to say that Andrew of was the descendant that came to America Then it tells about Robert and the rifles and his being in the Rev War Editors Note Robert died in but many of his descendants were in the Revolutionary War Editors Notes In the two above notes from Jean Vore we possibly see a generation back from Andrew Andy Baker as son of a Robert I of England personal Knight of the King More new information to uncover BB September Editors Note Delbert L Collins has researched this family for over twenty years has over individuals in his data base His research goes four generations up from Andrew Andy Baker to Simon Baker born Faversham Kent Co England Maybe Robert Baker personal Knight of the King will be found in the future Byron Brown January I believe our Baker family came from Kent Co England which would coincide with Andy s birth place of Buckinghamshire Co The reason I say this there is an Elizabeth Baker in my husbands family no parentage mentioned but she married a Scott and they lived at Scott s Hall Kent Co England Someplace else wish I could remember I read about our Baker family and this Same Elizabeth Baker showed up both having the same birthdate and year I have never been able to connect them exactly but there is a connection between my Husbands Elizabeth Baker and our Baker family Also to be able to gain permission to set up a Gun making company in this country would take permission of the King Queen and that family would have to be very close to the King a Knight or perhaps a relative For Elizabeth Baker b and her husband Sir Thomas Scott b were both connected to the Royal family Elizabeth Baker being his second wife The first known ancestor of the Bakers of Hancock Co Tn was Robert st of England Who was the King s personal Knight The King gave him his daughter as his wife and a castle and many riches and bestowed him with a Coat of Arms the Coat of Arms consisted of the castle with three roses in the yard The earliest known American ancestor was Andrew Baker b at Buckinghamshire England came to Boston Ma His son John Baker was b in Ma and immigrated to Pa His son Robert nd b Va d Lancaster Co Pa Where he was granted land and a gun boring mill for the manufacturing of firearms the Pa riffle by the King of England Robert Baker being the first man in recorded history to design and manufacture the Pa rifle At his death his son Caleb kept up the tradition and later used to great effect in the American Revolution The rifle was later known as the Hog Rifle and the Kentucky Rifle in Danel Boone s day Child of Andrew Baker and Unknown Wife is i John Baker born Abt in Mass died Abt in Lancaster County PA I believe don t hold me to it that I received most of my Baker information through the George W Baker s son of John Renta family who was my ggg grandfather and his son s family Judge Samuel Baker who was my gg grandfather As you will note in the genealogy sheets that George W together with several of his children including Samuel Baker moved west into Missouri with Samuel later moving to Iowa I do not have any proof of Andrew Baker of Buckinghamshire coming to this country his birthdate nor of his even staying here The puritans quakers kept good records It is my opinion at this time that he did not stay in the colonies but returned to England else there would be death records and burial records in one of the Churches I do not believe that our Andy Baker was an indentured Servant for this reason In order to come to the Colonies from you had to sign an allegance to the crown You could bring with you servants but no indentured servants were allowed during this period I am not sure when indentured servants were allowed into the colonies but know for sure it was not during the above periods Also on the ships passenger lists Servants were listed not all by their names but were listed as Servants of say SMITH John etc I know that the Severns family a knight for the crown did bring with him and his new bride servants but was not allowed additional servants until after But they were also sent by his father so were not considered indentured They were free men and women Not to be confused by being made a Freeman an oath taken by many of the Colonist during that period Taking the Freeman Oath meant you had to be an upstanding member of the community and be an active member of the local Church The Oath merely was swearing your allegence to the Crown here again in the Colonies and you were then afforded the title of Mr Mr was the highest title ever to be held in this country That is why George Washington said it was proper to call him Mr President no more no less It still rings true to this day Maggie I read about Robert I in your recent update of the Baker family and this is not the first time that I have heard of him In Hancock County Tennessee and Its People Volume there is an article by Bobby Earl Baker a direct descendant of the Pennsylvania Rifle manufacturers He also gives information about his line of ancestors that may add to your website He writes The first known ancestor of the Bakers of Hancock County was Robert I of England who was the King s personal Knight at the round table The King gave him his daughter as his wife and a castle and many riches and bestowed him with a Coat of Arms The Coat of Arms consisted of the castle with three roses in the yard The original name was Becker or Beaker meaning a vessel for drinking wine The Bakers may have

Frances Stephenson More About COLONEL JOHN BAKER Lived In Lancaster County Chester Counties PA Maggie The Only way to prove if they did exist in this country during the s in either in Massachusetts or Pennsylvania is to seek out Church records The colonist kept very good records I d give a lot to just jump on a plane and go to MA and PA to search these church records Unfortunately Doctors won t let me fly If indeed our Baker s belonged to one of the Churches they would be recorded I do believe that if they were here in the s they would have entered this country as a Quaker I do believe that if they had not been Quakers and entered during the time period they would have been stoned LOL So let s say they were not Quakers but merely pretended to be same they still would have been recorded in the church records There appears to be too much information regarding the Birth place of John Baker b Born in the colonies would be only two locations Virginia Boston MA possibly Salem but doubtful So that leaves Boston MA as his birthplace and his birth record That being the Old North CAgain I am too long winded Hubby says I can t say hello to anyone in less than minutes LOL As I said above I

Patty Greer To BBrown aol com I ve got a little time before I finish my Christmas dinner All my family is snowed and Iced in and we are getting sleet now I have your last or letters hear in front of me ever thing that I have found indicates that Robert and Samuel was Brothers Where Samuel family is I sure would like to know In my Settle line there is a very interesting thing or court records It seams that in Westmoreland Co Va during the Sept court session There was a suit against a Samuel Baker that had married Mary mother and widow of William Strother Since woman could not have a say in court her husband John Settle done it on her behalf Mary father died and they had a plantation Mary mother remarried Samuel Baker Mary died and Samuel was not to give the Settle Children there part of the Plantation that he took over when he married widow Strother I wish I knew her name but I don t have time to work on it right now This case is in the Orders Westmoreland Co Va Samuel had to give Mary and Sole Williams part of the plantation There is mention of a half Sister It is in the old writing and very hard to understand Now this could not be Robert Son for the dates is way off This land was in Northumberland Co upon the south side of Herrin Creek Beginning at the said mouth of the creek south half a point to a marked Black walnut tree standing in a clear field Don t you know it there today from thence East northerly upon the Herrin Creek northwest along the said creek to the place where it began being opposite the land of W Thomas Vause and my Mary Srother was born in England Now what I fine very unlikely or why what happened Robert Baker Sr died before Sept based on his son taking thing over form his father death Now John Baker his supposed Father Died in all in Lancaster Co Pa Son and father both died the same year Robert no will John no will No ship names for these men when they came over hear I also fell these Baker John Robert Sr had more children than just that one child Maybe not the same wife For a woman was just to have children and clean there home and work in the fields as the old saying went one on her apron strings one in her arms and one in the oven That made them a man so they through If she died we got another one to take her place or leave them to raise there self so I fell there a lot more of these children in this part of the family I heard a long time ago that there was boys and girls in England one of the boys left England and went to Germany then later on one of his children came to America Now it may not be all hear say Maybe a few facts In all of this I know that my line does come out of the gunmakers I also know that there are another line not Baker that had a Patent on the Ky rifle Merry Christmas Patty and Raymond Greer of

Samuel worked with his brother Robert Baker Lancaster Co In Robert bought out Samuel s interests Excerpts from GUNSMITHS OF LANCASTER COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA by James B Whisker Nearly all studies of the Pennsylvania Kentucky long rifle assume this distinctively American rifle was invented in Lancaster County sometime in the second quarter of the eighteenth century We find a number of pre Revolutionary War gunsmiths who may have made Pennsylvania Kentucky long rifles We have no idea what the early Baker files may have looked like c Lancaster County was formed out of Chester Co an original county of the Province of Pennsylvania on May Several of the Baker gunsmiths in the Pequea Valley had worked and died before the formation of the county ROBERT BAKER gunsmith Robert Baker was a gunsmith between and at the confluence of Pequea Creek and the Susquehanna River in Chester now Lancaster County In Robert Baker took over the shop operated by his brother Samuel Baker Robert died intestate September the Orphan s Court ordered an inventory of Robert s estate It showed tools of the gunsmith and blacksmith The total value of the tools in his gun barrel boring and gun shop was pounds Editors Note Based on all information found I believe Samuel Baker his brother Robert Baker were probably the first gun makers in America National Geographic Magazine stated that the Baker s invented the Pennsylvania Kentucky Long Rifle Unable to find the date of that article Excerpts from A RECORD OF THE BAKER AND BUFORD FAMILIES with Allied Lines by KATHERINE BAKER JOHNSON The first of this family in America appears to have been Robert Baker who settled in Conestoga Township Chester County Pennsylvania This township became Lancaster County in as this family does not appear on the tax list of any of the other townships it is possible that the settlement in Conestoga was the original home of the family from their arrival in America Abner Baker Great Grandson states in his Life Book that this family came to America from England in the early part of and that three brothers Samuel Andrew and Caleb were gunsmiths with a grant from the King of England to manufacture arms for the colonies The first record we find of Robert Baker is the administration of his estate dated Sept Robert Baker died without a will and his son Caleb Baker was appointed administrator of his estate along with these original papers at the Register s Office at the Court House in Lancaster County is the Administrators Bond and inventory and the administrator s accounts the bond was signed by the administrator Joseph Higginbotham and Tobias Hendricks sureties and witnessed by Douglas Baker and Joshua Lowe The inventory enumerates chattels harvest crops live stock and acres of land this was signed by Tobias Hendricks David Jones and Joseph Higginbotham appraisers Amount the creditors were the names of Caleb Baker Robert Baker Jr and Douglas Baker ubj BAKER RIFLES Date AM Pacific Daylight

those was a Baker Rifle that went down with the Tennesseans Also Ruth Burket s e mail is rburket hotmail com She has the unlucky family of both Bakers and Bollings She is from John Rentas family GOOD BAKERS BAD BAKERS BY CLYDE N BUNCH Kd vqd juno com My Aunt Lillie Baker Allen was born on Sacker Creek in Clay County Kentucky in She died in Lexington Kentucky in at the age of Her father George W Baker was born in Owsley County in and died at burning Springs in Clay County in The family shortly after his death moved from there Lillie was just a young woman at the time the love for the mountains and its people remained with her until the day she died This lady and her remarkable memory started me out Baker hunting Often when I talked to Aunt Lillie about her family she would refer to them as Good Bakers Bad Bakers It wasn t until after her death that I began to understand what she was trying to tell me She told me that her grandmother Ibby Baker was a Baker before she married She said the Ibby was a schoolteacher and that she went to Buffalo Creek in Owsley County to teach Here she met and married Jackson Baker Jackson died in leaving Ibby and their small son George After the death of her husband Ibby returned to Clay County and lived with her brother She died a year later Her son George W Baker was adopted and raised by her brother William Baker and wife Elizabeth Parker Aunt Lillie wrote me a letter one time about the Bakers on Buffalo Creek in Owsley County These were the one s she called Bad Bakers She said her father received word from his aunt Martha Gabbard to come up to Owsley County that the family had sold some land part of which belonged to his father His aunt went on to tell him that she was holding his part of the money from the sale for him Aunt Lillie said We didn t want him to go We thought it was a Catch We thought they were trying to get him up there to kill him To the relief of Aunt Lillie and the family her father George made the trip to Bull Skin and returned home safely I once asked Aunt Lillie where the Bakers came from She said They came from Liverpool England they were gunsmiths and that they came to this country to make guns for the colonies At the time Aunt Lillie told me this I paid little attention Of all the great things Aunt Lillie told me this statement would prove the most important She died without me having the opportunity of telling her what I learned about this unique family So I would like at this time to share my story with you We begin our story with Abner Baker first County Clerk of Clay County Abner was born in Prince Edward County Virginia September He came to Kentucky in and first settled in Garrard County where he married Elizabeth Buford He was appointed Clerk of Garrard County in and held this office until he moved to Clay County in Abner Baker kept a records keeping book throughout his life he called his Life Book In this small notebook he kept records about his family You can imagine my surprise when I read the following statement taken from this book Abner Baker stated that there were three brothers Samuel Andrew and Caleb who first came to America They were gunsmiths with a grant from the King of England to manufacture guns for the colonies He goes on to say that his grandfather Caleb Baker and his family removed from Lancaster Pennsylvania bought land and settled in what was then called The Backwoods in Amelia County Virginia on Buffalo Creek Was this just a coincident or were Aunt Lillie and Abner Baker talking about the same Baker family A Mr Samuel E Dyke a researcher in Lancaster County Pennsylvania finally convinced me I was on the right tract when I came across some writings This was a report given to the Kentucky Rifle s Association in It seems that the Association had employed Mr Dyke to do some research for them They wanted him to see if he could find out the person or persons responsible for making the first Pennsylvania Rifles or what was sometimes call the KENTUCKY LONG RIFLE Mr Dyke in his report states We feel as though these early gunsmiths came into Chester Pennsylvania or New Castle Delaware from abroad and migrated up the Susquehanna River to where the Pequea flows into it and set up shop making guns He goes on to say that Robert Baker came into Lancaster County Court on August and asked permission to erect a gun boring mill at the mouth of Pequea Creek on his land Permission was granted Robert Baker and his son Caleb set up their gun shop and operated it until It was at this time Robert Baker died His son Caleb Baker continued to operate this gun shop until the family moved to Amelia County Virginia The above Caleb Baker was the grandfather of Abner Baker first Clerk of Clay County Although Abner Baker is the one of the most interesting of people he is not the subject of our story I only used his statements and those of Mr Dyke to establish the fact that some of the Bakers now living in Clay and Owsley Counties can trace their ancestor s back to these early Pennsylvania Bakers Abner Baker in his Life Book stated that his grandfather Caleb had two brothers Andrew and Samuel Baker These two brothers would prove the most adventurous of this Baker Family In the early s Andrew Baker John Cox Enoch Osborn and several other neighboring families in Pennsylvania set out on a westward journey This journey eventually led them into the Yadkin River Valley in present day Wilkes County North Carolina This small group of Pennsylvanians would be among the first to settle in the area Some of these people settled along the Yadkin River others of the more adventurous nature crossed the Blue ridge Mountains and settled along New River in what is now Ash and Allegheny Counties North Carolina No white man had attempted settlement here before New River was known at the time only by it s Indian name Saxphaw It was here along the south branch Andrew Baker made his first home Andrew Baker remained in the area of New River until about He then decided to push even deeper into Indian country He moved down New River into what is now Grayson County Virginia very near the North Carolina line Here Andrew staked out a large track of land he called his Peach Tree Bottom track But the next summer he and his family were run out by the Indians He returned to his prior settlement on New River where he would remain for the next ten years or so He did however make one other attempt to settle his Peach Tree Bottom track This was in or This time he encountered another problem In Andrew s long absence Dr Thomas Walker a surveyor for the Loyal Land Company had staked and claimed the Peach Tree Bottom track for his employers He had to now purchase a acres of his original claim before he could resettle on it again It seems that it just wasn t meant to be The following year he was once again forced out by the Indians and back to his old settlement One might wonder why Andrew was so determined to settle this particular track of land The answer lay in what was on and in this land more so than the land itself For you see one of the largest iron ore deposits in this area was discovered on the land I think Andrew Baker and at least one of his sons were involved in the Iron business His son James Baker and he built several large iron furnaces along Cranberry Creek a tributary of the south branch of New River The remains of some of these Iron Furnaces can be seen even today They were at their peek production during the Revolutionary War The Balance of this article THE GOOD BAKERS THE BAD BAKERS by Clyde N Bunch is found in notes on John Renta Baker in this site Editors Note It is interesting that a Thomas Anderson Sr from Kentucky was with General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans and stood next to another Kentucky sharpshooter who shot General Puckingham from his white charger The general thought he well out of range but underestimated the accuracy and range of the Kentucky Long Rifle After the battle Thomas Anderson walked back to Kentucky only to find that his family had moved to Dubois County Indiana So he just walked on over to Indiana Two of his sons John and Thomas Jr married two of my GG aunts daughters of David G Nancy Brittain Brown in DuBois County Indiana Byron Brown January Wins Battle of New Orleans Jackson was then ordered to defend New Orleans Finding the city foolishly ignoring its danger he quickly put it under martial law and rallied the citizens to prepare for attack To build up his small regular army he

Learning Company Inc COLONIAL FAMILIES OF PHILADELPHIA In April or early in May Philip Syng had surveyed by his order and to his use two Hundreds acres of land upon the west bank of the Susquehanna River at a place known as The Mine This tract was within the bounds of Pa but it was claimed by Philip Syng and Co under a Maryland title A complaint having been made by Robert Baker and James McClean before Francis Worley Esq a Justice of the Peace for Chester County Syng was committed into the custody of the Sheriff of Philadelphia by the warrant of Sir William Keith Baronet the Governor who had met Syng at Patterison s on April and threatened to have him punished if he presumed to make any survey of the land in question Editors Note It is believed that this Mine is where the ore came from to make Baker guns Editors Note Robert James Baker the gunsmith must have more than one wife I have changed birth dates of all children according to dates found in Patti Greer s file Editors note Some researchers report that Robert Baker was ordered to go to England to make guns for either King William or Queen Anne according to time frame In America these two Wars with France were know as King Williams War Queen Anne s War They covered the period from late s He returned to America with a grant to make guns for the Colonies This is why some other researchers think Robert Baker was the first of this line to come to America which was actually the time of his returning to his native soil Some say he came from Liverpool England He may have on his return from making guns probably teaching cutting of rifling in barrels to others while there Robert Baker settled in Conestoga Township Chester County PA later Lancaster County PA He bought acres of land on the Susquehanna River from Col John French in This seems to be time frame of his return to America so we might assume that he was ordered to England by Queen Anne whose War dates were This land was located on mile from the junction of Pequea Creek and the Susquehanna River Robert s son Caleb paid taxes on this land from until Robert and his sons were gunsmiths and were commissioned by the King of England to make fire arms for the Colonies Later the Bakers would join the Colonies against England in the Revolutionary War August Robert Baker had Jacob Taylor Surveyor with permission from William Penn lay out a site for erection of a gun mill See Taylor Papers From Pattie Greer file In February iron ore was found near the site of the Baker tract From Pattie Greer file Robert Baker left no will and his son Caleb was

ANDREW BAKER is thought to have moved into Ashe Co NC in The French and Indian War forced him to leave the area but he is supposed to have returned about A study of loose papers at the North Carolina Land Grant Office gives some added information On April ANDREW BAKER made an entry for a tract of land on the South Fork which was surveyed a week later In these papers reference is made to the line of his former survey and to his old survey Since it is known that entries were being made for land just to the south in the McDowell Co area in early there is every reason to believe that ANDREW BAKER had returned to the New River once the threat of Indians had abated The first white inhabitants of Ashe Co were the hunters It has been estimated that a hunter could earn as much as to dollars per season in hunting and trapping game for pelts It was a love of this income and the hunt that compelled many men to live their lives on the fringes of civilization Capt John Cox is ed as saying he could remember only cabins from the lead mines Fort Chisewell to the head of the Watauga But the land entries of are replete with references to places such as George Collin s old c Martin Gambill s

Penington s and ANDREW BAKER S roles in power were short lived It is believed the Penington s were Quakers and were not considered ardent enough Whigs In Sept Micajah s estate along with a number of

These groups did not move into the public domain in ignorance of their exact location but rather like the children of Israel they sent their Calebs and Joshuas ahead to spy out the land and prepare the way Certainly Andrew BAKER was a Joshua on the New River frontier After his initial essay when he came from the Yadkin Valley in the s but was driven back by the Indians he returned about with

Jean Vore jvore iti net In one of the old records and I can t remember if it was the Battle of Kings Mountain or Draper papers Benjamin Bolling says that his sister married Old Andrew Baker None of the children of John Bolling and Elizabeth Blair fit the age group and all are accounted for If we accept that John Renta was born in Editors Note I believe he was born Byron Brown his sister cannot be from that marriage She would have been when she had her first child However little is known about John Bolling and Elizabeth Lewis I have an old genealogy that has no author on it that says John and Eliz Lewis had girls names unknown Mary would fit in this family just fine I got a letter recently that said Eliz Lewis had at least one girl and died in childbirth Did that child live I know I am out on a limb but I have put Mary Mollie in that marriage She would have been considered a sister to Benjamin and would be the right age for an early marriage Editors Note It is reported by Pattie Greer that Mary Mollie Bowling was only years old when he married Old Andrew Baker Subj Mary Molly Bowling Bolling Date AM Eastern Standard Time From MaggieCal To NL G BBrown I think I have solved the mystery Mary Molly Bowling Bolling but no absolute proof Also my theories have not always proven to be correct But since I believe that Mary Molly Bolling s birth records etc were expunged from the Bolling family To the point that Mary Molly spelled her last name Bowling With no parentage listed Please bear with me for a few sentences My founding Father idol has always been Thomas Jefferson I think I have read everything about him that has been published this will have bearing on my theory Proof In Colonial America as per English Law it was illegal for any white man to marry an Indian Punishable by death This rule had one exception It was legal in the Virginia Colony Sanctified by England since Pocahontas was of Royal blood You will note in all the Bolling records that no Bolling left Virginia prior to the Revolutionary War Except Mary Molly Bolling The Randolph s married heavily into the Bolling Family When the Revolutionary War became evident the Randolph s including their Bolling Spouse and children left Virginia and returned to England After they War the returned to the United States Historical fact documented in many places The Randolph s returning to England had a profound affect on Thomas Jefferson as his mother was a Randolph and his Uncle that had raised him was a Randolph and the Randolph property abutted Thomas Jefferson s It was not until after the Revolutionary War that the Bolling s moved to other States in the Union except Mary Molly Most of the States in the United States did not prohibit the marriages of Indians and Whites Mary Molly could not have identified herself as being part Indian or it would have been a death sentence for her her husband and her children Also I now believe that Mary Molly Bolling was a daughter of John Bolling and Mary Kennon The birth date is right I do not believe her to be the daughter of Robert Bolling and Jane Rolfe But rather the granddaughter of Jane Rolfe and Robert Bolling Below are some notes from the Jones Family regarding their connection to Pocahontas This site also gives additional Pocahontas genealogy e g her grandparents etc It was the last sentences that got me thinking now that is sometimes a dangerous thing Notes for MATOAKA POCAHONTAS POWHATAN In John Rolfe and his wife Pocahontas in company with Sir Thomas Dale also of the company ventured to England to show off the Princess to the King and Queen While in London she gave birth to their only child a son Thomas Rolfe Not long after this Pocahontas died at Gravesend John returned to his beloved Virginia with his young son and when Thomas was old enough to attend school John sent him to England for that purpose and he took lodgings and was under the care and tutorship of his uncle Henry Rolfe Thomas thereafter returned to his home in Virginia and settled on a large estate in old Henrico County now Chesterfield above where Petersburg now is He married Miss Jane Poythress and by her had one daughter Jane Rolfe before his untimely death The American Colonies of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries all had stringent laws prohibiting interracial marriages Because Pocahontas and John Rolfe were married very early in the seventeenth century with the approval of the then Governor of the colony and because Pocahontas was of royal albeit aborigine blood the statutes in Virginia made an exception in their case The laws of the other colonies however were very strict and the punishment was severe Thus Thomas Rolfe was safe but only in Virginia or back in England He chose to return to Virginia to claim the vast amount of land Powhatan had given the couple when John and Pocahontas married When Jane Poythress died after bearing an only daughter Thomas Rolfe is reputed to have left Virginia and moved to North Carolina where he is also reputed to have married again With the laws of North Carolina so strict both then and during the next century or so it is understandable that Thomas would never have mentioned the fact that he was half Indian nor would that information have likely been passed down in the family tales If in fact Thomas did remarry after he left Virginia and sired a number of male children it would be reasonable to assume that one or more of them returned to the motherland particularly if they knew of their ancestor s ethnic background and were therefore nervous about remaining

have tons of stuff on Benjamin Bolling and you will read of the results of our long Benjamin Study in the next newsletter Though we aren t loaded with data on Molly born about and married Andrew Baker around we know quite a bit about the long relationship between the Bolling and Baker families Though we are still working on authentication we have enough authenticated evidence for me to tell you the following story The immigrant Robert Bolling had a younger son named Edward who was born in Edward met and married a girl named Slaughter we think her first name was Mary when he was still a teenager He also became a ship s captain for Col Byrd while still in his teens Edward and his wife had a son named Benjamin who was born in in Virginia A year later Edward died at sea at the mighty age of twenty three There is strong evidence that Edward s widow left VA shortly after Edward s death and settled in NC We also believe that the Baker family had also settled there because it was at this time that we first see unions between Bollings and Bakers and this habit continued for more than one generation An ex le of this is the fact that Benjamin Bolling Edward s son had a son who married Martha Baker and the names are connected by marriage even after some of the folks migrated to Kentucky Because of Molly s birth date I am personally unable to identify who her parents might be She was too old to be a child of Edward Bolling and too young to be a child of Edward s son and therefore a sister to the renowned Benjamin about who we talk so much To help me out I am turning to the fellow I have selected as the greatest authority on the Benjamin Bolling line That is Chet Bolling a descendant of the two Benjamins and a student of the line for almost half a century Chet has been under the weather recently but if he knows the answer as to who Molly s parents were you can bet that we ll get a quick answer by e mail In the meantime I must admit that I cannot pin down the parents of Molly Bolling Baker although I am aware of the close relationship between the two families We ll just have to wait and see what Chet has to say See you in Richmond next August Bud Wm Kennon Sr was a

ROLFE the granddaughter of Pocahontas and John Rolfe Jr has ever existed From their marriage ONE and only ONE child was born named JOHN Bolling b January Virginia and he died April Virginia This son JOHN and his ONLY wife MARY KENNON had only ONE son and FIVE daughters This lineage is known as The RED Bolling s i e Indian Blood descents Next ROBERT Bolling raised his son for three years after the death of JANE Rolfe six months after birth of John She died of Typhoid and had been looked after by visits of particular Indians related to Pocahontas and they looked after baby JOHN with visits until after the third marriage of Robert Bolling in December Until this marriage happened Robert raised John with a Nannie in his household The third marriage for Robert happened with Anne Dade Stith d o John Drury Stith Their descents are known as The WHITE Bollings NO Indian Blood Child and son JOHN married in to MARY KENNON VA and the marriage is recorded From this ONLY marriage one and only one son was born and he was named JOHN Bolling born VA There are sisters to this JOHN Bolling Jr who grew up a privileged life in Colonial America He did have one big vice and that was he John Jr liked women He also liked to drink and party but he followed in his father and grandfather shoes as a Member of The House of Burgess the ruling political body of Colonial America This John Bolling Jr inherited all his Father and Grandfather holdings and property which had become massive with thousand of acres purchased and given by the Indian Nations to Robert Bolling and wife Jane Rolfe the Granddaughter of Pocahontas and the only living daughter heir of her father Thomas Rolfe b in America before any trip to England but after death of Pocahontas in at Godsend England he Thomas was left

'Descendants of George Baker of Pownal VT Early History of the George Baker Family of Bennington Co VT and Otsego Co NY EARLY HISTORY OF THE GEORGE BAKER FAMILY OF BENNINGTON CO VT AND OTSEGO CO N Y Compiled by Zervia Barnes Birdsall and Mildred Birdsall Covert George Baker was one of the pioneer settlers of Pownal Vermont This place was first settled by the Dutch in but the town government was not organized until when the town was named in honor of Thomas Pownal governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony It formed part of the territory know as the New H shire Grants over which there was so much trouble with New York as that colony claimed the land which really belonged to the New England territory The first known reference to George Baker contained in early records is found on page Vol I Vermont Historical Society Collection where his name appears with other residents of Pownal as one of the signers of a petition to the King dated Nov in which the King is requested to restrain the New York colonists from further encroachments on the New H shire Grants Prior to nothing is positively known concerning George Baker but it is believed that he was born in Massachusetts about Some papers belonging to Leroy Baker of Osceola Tioga Co Pa record statements made by Chauncey Baker son of George whose father was Daniel Baker to the effect that Daniel s father George Baker of Pownal Vt came to this country with two brothers one of whom was Col William Henry Baker But as no other record to substantiate this has been found it seems more probable that he was a descendant of Edward Baker of Lynn Mass who was a freeman of that town in and who died there in The New England Genealogical and antiquarian Register Vol V p contains considerable data concerning this family in substance as follows It is known that this Edward Baker had five sons possibly more Joseph and Timothy of North ton Edward and Thomas of Lynn and John of Dedham Timothy was the leading character of North ton He had five children John Thomas Edward Prudence Deliverance The oldest son John Capt John Baker lived on the old homestead in North ton and was one of the most influential men of the town He had seven sons John Noah Aaron Elisha Stephen Timothy Elijah and two daughters All the sons except Timothy who died while on the expedition against Louisburg married and settled in western Massachusetts all lived to be years old or over and all left numerous families whose descendants are all over the United States from Vermont to Texas Perhaps George Baker was son one of the younger sons of Thomas or Edward sons of Timothy Baker of North ton or it may be that his father was one of the other sons of John Baker who was the oldest son of Timothy The early records of Pownal town give the following data about George Baker and some of his family In the earlier records the name is spelled Bacor but afterwards Baker There were six school districts in Pownal in the early days and the fifth district is described as follows Beginning at John Matison s north to George Bacor s thence to Bennington line going east on the First District all to be one district A deed given by George Gardner to Benjamin Gardiner recorded in Vol II of the town records gives one boundry as follows thence running to the old fence now standing where George Bacor once lived This deed is dated the nd day of February in the th year of His Majestie s reign that is Feb as George III became King in The clause where George BAcor once lived is significant as it proves that he had changed his place of residence in Pownal prior to Vol II of the records contains several lists of Pownal freemen and of those who took the freeman s oath for the first time in certain years The list of those resident in include George Baker and the same list records Joseph Briggs afterwards Capt Briggs and many others who were in Briggs company with George Baker and Daniel Baker in service of the United States during the Revolution The list of those who took the freeman s oath in all of whom must have been years old or over gives Daniel Baker probably the son of George This lists in the early records of Pownal are fast becoming illegible and for that reason they are given Names of Freemen of the Town of Pownal Elder Benjamin Gardner Nathaniel Seeley David Page Peter Robards Stephen Perigo John Lareby Stephen Osborn Charles Wright Richard Weaver Daniel Miers Jeremiah Eldrich Nathan Eldrich Jonothan Oles Benjamin Pratt Samuel Popple Abraham Gardner Silas Watson Rufus Weaver David Gardner Benjamin Card Daniel Phillips JOSEPH

Dehooty Joshua Hamilton Job Phillings Amos Potter David Stamrerd DANIEL BAKER Peter Bavit Calib Gibs The first known recorded deed of property owned by George Baker is given in Vol II of the Pownal records By this deed dated and recorded April David Page conveys to George Bacor both of Pownal a parcel of land situated in the N W part of Pownal bounded as follows Adjoining west on a lot of land lately owned by Capt Briggs now the property of Abel Parker north on a A lot laid out for the use of schools in Pownal town east on Francis Bates land south on the highway north of Jonathan Cards land containing A and is the th division lot laid out to the right of Nathaniel Phelps original grantee in said town of Pownal The price paid was s Vol III records that November Josiah Bates conveyed to George Bacor for the sum of a small tract of land adjoining the property he bought of David Page Vol V records the transfer of the above properties by George Baker spelling changed in this deed to Benjamin Gardner and Silas Card of Pownal The total purchase price was The date of sale is February and the deed was recorded February No other records of property transfer to or by George Baker occur in Pownal records and it is supposed that he went to Otsego County N Y directly after the sale of his Pownal farm This farm of A is situated in the hill country a few miles from Pownal Center in the N W part of Pownal township It is now part of a A farm owned by Mr Frank Wilson but is still called the Baker lot A complete record of all transfers of this property with description of boundries and other interesting matter has been compiled and is now in possession of the historian The place where the old house stood overlooks the highway which led from the Vermont settlements to those near Albany N Y Looking to the south one gets a beautiful view of Greylock the most famous of the Berkshire Hills and it is worthwhile to remember that George Baker and his family sturdy pioneers living there so many years ago looked daily upon a landscape which is now one of the most famous in all New England Vol III records the purchase of property by Wm Bacor possibly a son of George who bought A of William and Gardner Hall July the price being In Wm Baker sold this land except a small tract containing a mill and in he sold the mill with its surrounding plot No further records of property owned by Wm Baker appear in the Pownal records He probably went to New York State perhaps to Otsego County According to tradition he afterward went to Philadelphia and became very wealthy The first census of Vermont taken in records George Baker as follows George Baker Pownal Town free white males of years and upwards including heads of families one free white males under years two free white females including heads of families three no other persons no slaves This means that in there were only four children at home two boys under sixteen probably Joseph and Stephen and two daughters Asa and Susan The Vermont Revolutionary Rolls p record George Baker and Daniel Baker as having served in the company of Capt Joseph Briggs from October November The Vermont records are very incomplete and no known record exists to prove that George Baker took part in the battle of Bennington but family tradition and abundant proofs of his residence in Vermont in the vicinity of Bennington from to make one certain that such service was rendered Perhaps he was a member of Col Herrick s body of militia or of Capt Dewey s company in Col Brush s militia Egbert Baker of Harpursville who died in had the powder horn which according to tradition was carried by George Baker in this battle Egbert received it from his father Reed son of Thomas to whom it was given by his Reed s grandfather George Baker Mr Ezra Stevens an old resident of Milford recalls some stories of the Revolution which he heard told by Thomas Baker s children He says that George Baker and three of his sons were at Bennington battle and that Thomas who was but a lad went with his father s team to help clear the slain from the field The records in possession of Leroy Baker see p also state that George Baker and three of his sons were soldiers in the Revolution Mr Stevens says that one of the older sons Abel Aylesworth Baker was a colonel in the Colonial army Ezra Stevens father William Stevens came to Otsego County in and lived for many years near Schuyler Lake When he went to live in the town of Milford in some of the Bakers were there and it is supposed they came in the early s perhaps in The first recorded deed of property owned by the family is that of the Thomas Baker farm A from the Otego patent purchased in December of William Temple Franklin through his agent William Cooper The price paid was s d Since this farm near Milford N Y has been owned by some member of the Thomas Baker family It is now the home of Ralph Baker son of Warren L whose father was Leonard son of Thomas son of George Baker of Pownal Edward Baker s farm was also from the Otego patent bought of Thomas Mumford in November A for s d The first recorded deed of property owned by George Baker in Otsego County was placed on file March though the farm was purchased in It contained A and was distinguished as farm or subdivision B of lot No in the A of land on a branch of the Susquehanna River and Cherry Valley Creek granted by letters patent to Volkert Outhoudt and six others It is probable that George Baker lived on this farm some years before he owned it The farm was purchased of the executors of Catherin Lawrence of New York City and the sum paid for it was of good and lawful money of the United States The descriptions and legal terms of the old time deeds differ from those of today and as a matter of interest and as something of a curiosity the following ation from the deed of the property to George Baker is given Folio s p Records of Conveyances Otsego County N Y Samuel Lawrence Robert Watts Junior Stephen N

executors and that it is not incumbered and that the title is clear S Lawrence Executor R Watts Jr Executor S N Bayard Executor J W Patterson Executor Witness for identity of men Daniel Ryan appeared Feb before P J Hildreth Master in Chacery Recorded March o clock p m Immediately following the record of this deed the transfer of this farm March by George Baker and Elizabeth his wife to their son Stephen is recorded the date of record being March when George Baker appeared before John Russel Judge of Common Pleas and acknowledged the deed The farm remained in Stephen s possession and he lived there until his death February After Stephen s death his son Daniel had the farm until February when it was sold by him ad administrator to Moses and Ester Chidester of Milford From time to time the Chidisters sold portions of the farm until only A remained of the original A This remaining plot changed hands several times and March it became the property of Edward Seeger who paid for it In he sold two lots one of A and one of A and in November the remaining A were deeded to his son Dudley Seeger who son Levant now owns what remains intact of the farm George Baker purchased in The historian has a complete record of all transfers of this farm from The house in which Mr Seeger lives was built by Stephen Baker but several changes from the original plan have been made since Edward Seeger became the owner Originally there were two large fireplaces These have been removed though the foundation of the great chimney about feet square is still standing in the cellar It was impossible to remove this as the whole structure rests upon it The house is very desirably located on a gently sloping hill on the west bank of the Susquehanna River The view from any point is attractive The winding river merging into Goodyear Lake the thickly wooded hills that bound the valley the uplands from the flats occupied by prosperous farmers whose homes are most inviting and just to the south the little church at Milford Center with its white spire above the clustering maples a landmark of historic prominence all this and much more makes the old homestead seem a goodly heritage and one is glad to recall the valley as a place toward the settlement of which one s ancestors contributed both labor and capital It is interesting to know that the site of the first school house in the town of Milford was on the George Baker farm In this log school house which stood a short distance to the north of the Baker homestead the Baptist church of Milford Center was organized by Rev Josiah Morris March and George Baker lived to be a very old man A Mr Rowland of Milford who died several years ago at some years of age told Alfred Baker of Laurens when he acknowledged the deed of his farm to his son Stephen and November when Mr Stevens was born The vital statistics were poorly kept during the early days of Pownal and they contain no record of the marriage of Geoge Baker or of the birth of any of his children It is supposed that he married Polly Brown perhaps about and that they had ten children as followes Abel Daniel William Charles Edward Thomas Asa a daughter Joseph Stephen Susan It is possible that the wife Polly died before George Baker left Vermont indeed that may have been the reason for his disposing of his Pownal farm in and going to New York State where several of his children had already established homes The deed of the Otsego County farm to the son Stephen in is executed by George Baker and Elizabeth his wife but the last name of the second wife is still unknown Nine of George Baker s children married and it is positively known that Daniel Edward Thomas Joseph and Stephen came to Otsego County N Y Probably Asa and William were for a time in Otsego county The following information concerning the ten children mentioned above is of interest to all descendants of George Baker ABEL BAKER The records of Seneca County N Y under date of March give Abel Baker as a resident of the town of Owasco County of Cayuga and record the sale by him of some Seneca County property The deed is witnessed by Elisha Baker In the Cayuga records the first entry under Abel Baker April records him as paying for a portion of lot No in the town of Sempronius Various other records follow which Abel Baker and Aurora Baker his wife transfer parts of this plot in lot No receiving in all much more than was paid for it If the family records are true in respect to George Baker s son Abel going out Seneca County way the entries mentioned must refer to him as no other Abel Baker is given in Seneca or Cayuga records prior to or from to Newell and Lorenzo Baker of Seneca County grandsons of Abel Baker were in the Civil War with Harrison T Baker son of Russel son of Thomas of Milford N Y DANIEL BAKER The town records of Pownal Vermont record Daniel Baker as having taken the Freeman s oath in so he must have been at least years old at that time He is known to be one of George Baker s older children and it is probable that he was in the Revolutionary War with his father On p of the Vermont Rolls a Daniel Baker is recorded as having served in Capt Joseph Brigg s company from October to November the same company and service as that of George Baker Family tradition has it some of George s children came to Otsego Co several years before he did Chauncey Baker states in the records which Leroy Baker has that Daniel came to Laurens N Y when his son George was about years old or about but is seems probable that he came earlier than that Possibly the Daniel Baker recorded in the first census as a resident of Otsego town Montgomery County N Y is this Daniel Baker The following is given concerning him Free white males over years two free white males under years two free white females three The first recorded ded of property owned by Daniel Baker is that which conveyed to him in a A plot in Otsego County in Lot No of the Otego patent granted to Thomas Wharton and others Daniel Baker s estate at the time of his death comprised several hundred acres as there are records showing that his son George bought of Daniel Baker s heirs A March of Nathan Baker and his wife Hannah A of land belonging to the estate of Daniel Baker and a little late A more July also A of Benjamin Howe and wife the plot being described as part of the lot belonging to the heirs of Daniel Baker In December James Green and Asa Baker Green his wife signed over their claim to her brother George which leads one to conclude that George Baker son of Daniel may have acquired title to all of his father s property These records establish the fact that Daniel Baker must have died between the year when he purchased the A plot and March when the first sale of property belonging to the heirs of Daniel Baker is recorded His wife survived him many years The county records state under date of May that Susannah wife of Daniel Baker deceased of Laurens deeded to George Baker a A lot Early family records give the name of Daniel s wife as Anna Cumins either he was twice married or the name Anna was short for Susannah Daniel Baker had ten children Nathan b m Hannah

information has been obtained from records that many of the family cannot consult conveniently Sufficient data is given to enable any member of the family to prove eligibility for membership in the patriotic societies Sons of the American Revolution and Daughters of the American Revolution provided his or her ancestry can be traced back to George Baker of Pownal Vermont or Daniel Baker his son

in born in NY http www rootsweb com nyotsego histmil htm EARLY HISTORY OF THE TOWN OF MILFORD AND OTHER PARTS OF OTSEGO CO From to by EZRA STEVENS George Baker s Family George Baker of Bennington was the next settler at Milford Center He came in purchased a farm just north of Mr Mumford s large purchase which is owned occupied by Dudley Segar at present Mr Baker had seven sons two daughters His sons names were Abel Daniel Charles Thomas Edward Joseph Stephen His daughters names were Asie Susan Mr Baker sold his farm in Vermont when he removed to Milford there was remaining unpaid on it He sent his oldest son Col Abel to Vermont for the money He collected the money that was the last ever heard of him It was believed by some that he skipped with the money by others that he was robbed murdered At all events he was never heard from after he received the money Mr Baker s th son Thomas married Sarah Morton located at Edson Corners Edward married Hannah Mumford Charles Stephen Joseph all married raised large families Daniel married Susannah Anna Cumins Charles Stephen and Joseph all married and raised large families and located in different towns Edward Baker s oldest son George left home and went to New York in and never returned to Milford He remained in the city and when the T______ cholery broke out in it was supposed he was one of the subjects for he was never heard from after His daughter Linda and his youngest son Mumford Baker removed to Pennsylvania Both married and never returned to Milford George Daniel s son married and settled in Laurens Stephen remained on his father s farm in Milford Center until his death He had one son Daniel who married Nancy Keyes sold the old farm that was first settled by his grandfather and returned to Laurens The following served in the Northern Division under Arnold Gates and Stark Col Abel Baker major Gidean Marlette Privates George Baker Daniel Baker Charles Baker Artemas Ward James Frasier James Westcott Lemuel Lilly George Baker and his three sons Abel Daniel and Charles and Judah Waters and Jacob Wellman participated in the battle of Bunker Hill and afterwards Abel Baker Judah Waters and Jacob Wellman were transferred to the regular army under General Washington Biographical History of the Baker Family George Baker the senior of the Baker family was born in England before and was persecuted for his religious proclivities consequently he took refuge in Holland He joined the Puritans and embarked in the Mayflower with the Pilgrims and came to America and landed at Plymouth in Mr Baker afterwards settled near Boston Massachusetts I think that George Baker the first Baker that settled in Milford was a grandson of the Baker that came from England George Baker of the first Milford one of the settlers was at Concord Lexington and Bunker Hill At the battle of Bunker Hill his three oldest sons participated with their father in the fight His sons names were Abel Daniel and Charles Abel was promoted to the office of Colonel and after was under Washington in the main Army It is stated in an antecedent chapter that Abel was sent to Bennington by his father to collect a sum of money and that was the last that was heard of him That was a mistake It was learned after that he procured the money and with what he had of his own he went to Philadelphia and went to speculating and became immensely rich But he never returned his father s money The old gentleman when he earned the facts in the case felt very much grieved over his misconduct towards his father He was a man that stood high in the community and little did he think his son would resort to so comtemptible and outrageous an act as to rob his father of his money when he had placed confidence in his integrity The old man felt very much grieved and said he deserved severe punishment The poor old man had the misfortune to die a horrible death from the effects of a cancer Mr Baker was in the hard fought battle of Bennington under General Stark who said we will win this battle or Mollie Stark will sleep a widow tonight Mr Baker sent for his son Thomas to fetch his horses to carry in the wounded and disabled soldiers and tell the people we have killed all the Indians and Tories this side of hell Census Bainbridge Chenango County NY Chauncey Baker age b NY Abigail age Eliza age Henry age Erastus age George

born Sept in PA Lee M age born Sept in PA Baker Chauncey age born Feb in NY with Parents from CT NY Dear Mary I think I ve had a breakthrough on our family tree concerning Chauncey Baker On the Mormon website at www familysearch com I found an entry for a Chauncey Baker who was born on Feb in Milford Otsego County NY to Susan Nott and George Baker and died in in Knoxville PA I knew our Chauncey Baker was born in Otsego County around that time so I sent to Pennsylvania for his death certificate which showed him as dying in Shippen PA on October and being buried in Knoxville PA on October The death certificate listed his father as George Baker and his mother as Susan Knox It also says that he was born on Feb in Otsego County NY I still wanted more evidence that this was our Chauncey so I checked out the Census records to see if there were any other Chauncey Bakers around the same age In the index to the census I found five Chauncey Bakers Our Chauncey Baker was years old living in Bainbridge NY Of the other Chaunceys one in Allegany County was years old too old to be confused with our Chauncey Another in Granger County Ohio was age also too old to be confused with our Chauncey The remaining two were Chauncey S Baker a year old clergyman who was born in Vermont living in Lancaster NY and Chauncey Baker age living with his year old wife Emeline in Sodus NY I then looked for these three Chauncey Bakers in the census The Census index showed four Chauncey Bakers born around the same time The first was born in Maine and was living in California definitely not our Chauncey The second was the Chauncey S Baker born in Vermont and still living in New York State the clergyman from the Census The third was a New York born Chauncey Baker living in Antwerp Michigan with his wife Emmaline obviously the Chaucey from Sodus NY The remaining Chauncey was living in Deerfield in Tioga County Pennsylvania He was years old born in New York living with a wife named Lucy in the home of his son James Baker aged also born in New York Since this last is obviously the Chauncey Baker who died in and we know he was born in Otsego County like our Chauncey I feel certain that this is probably our ancestor Since our Chauncey was married to an Abigail in and the Tioga county Chauncey was married to a Lucy I am guessing that he remarried after Abigail s death sometime between and I did not find Chaucey or George Baker in the Census in either Bainbridge NY or Shippen Knoxville or Deerfield Township Pennsylvania I did find George Baker aged in the Bainbridge census I also found Chauncey in the Census for Shippen in Tioga County Pennsylvania He was living with his daughter Libbie A Schoonover born Feb in PA and her husband Chester Schoonover They were living next door to Charles L Baker born April in PA and his family I think it is likely that Chauncey and his family moved to Pennsylvania between and and that George Baker returned to Bainbridge NY before According to the Mormon website George Baker the father of Chauncey Baker was born in Pownal Vermont on April to Daniel Baker and Susanna Cumins and died on Sept in Laurens NY His father Daniel was born around in Pownal Vermont to another George Baker and Polly Brown Daniel died on March in Milford NY Daniel s father George Baker is listed as having been born in Massachusetts in and having died in Milford NY on November I looked up George Baker in the Censuses The Census shows him age living in Laurens NY with his wife Susannah age and five children He is listed as having been born in Vermont and his wife is listed as having been born in New York In the Census they are now alone He is age and she is age They are both listed as having been born in Connecticut I also found a website at http www rootsweb com nyotsego histmil htm which is titled EARLY HISTORY OF THE TOWN OF MILFORD AND OTHER PARTS OF OTSEGO CO From to by EZRA STEVENS It includes a lot of information about the Baker family and how Daniel and George fought in the Revolutionary war and were among the first settlers of Milford NY Some of the information is not completely accurate however They claim the Bakers go back to a George Baker who fled to Holland for religious freedom and then came over on the Mayflower I checked the records and there was no George Baker on the Mayflower Perhaps it was an ancestor by a different name who came on the Mayflower I also doubt that they took part in the battles of Lexington and Concord since they lived in Vermont If I find anything else I ll let you know I plan to look for Chauncey in the censuses and to see if I can find his burial records in Knoxville PA Perhaps I can find Abigail s burial as well Wish me luck Your cousin Tony Research Update Census confirms that the Chauncey Baker in Tioga county Pennsylvania and the Chauncey Baker who lived in Bainbridge New York in are the one and the same Chauncey his wife Abigail and their children Eliza Henry Erastus George Jonathan

Contact Us Syndicate Home National Commentary Helen Thomas Baker Riding To The Rescue Again Helen Thomas Baker Riding To The Rescue Again By Helen Thomas Thursday October WASHINGTON Former Secretary of State James Baker is riding to the rescue of President Bush So what else is new Baker has been there many times before for the Bush family to pull their chestnuts out of the fire This time it appears he is being called to help President Bush finesse his way out of the Iraqi debacle and save face Smooth talking Baker is a master at resolving tricky situations and he does it with a smile He is the Republican co chairman of a bipartisan panel called The Iraq Study Group created last March with a nudge from Congress The group is working on a report on Iraq which may offer an exit plan as an alternative to the president s widely touted stay the course policy But it won t be released until after the November election Naturally Ultimately the report may get Bush off the hook in the no win situation in Iraq At a news conference Wednesday the president reiterated his pledge not to get out of Iraq before the job is done But Bush said he was prepared to change tactics if Baker s team recommends a switch The word tactics may be a rhetorical device to help ease an inglorious U S exit from the war now nearing its fourth year In an interview on Sunday on ABC TV Baker said in his usual manner of lawyerly obfuscation I think it s fair to say our commission believes that there are alternatives between the stated alternatives the ones that are out there in the political debate of stay the course and cut an run The phrase cut and run has become the president s favored jibe at Democrats who urge a pullout from Iraq Former Indiana Rep Lee Hamilton a Democrat is co chairman of the group One can only hope that its report will have a major impact on the floundering administration which has to contend with growing American casualties in an unpopular war and rising discontent among its own loyal Republicans in national polls Unfortunately Baker flatly rejected a quick withdrawal from Iraq on grounds that you would see the biggest civil war you ve ever seen Well what does Baker think is going on in Iraq right now Meantime Bush has rejected as just not credible a report of public health researchers that there have been more than Iraqi civilian casualties since the U S invasion in Bush is seeing some of his own party leaders turning off on the war Sen John Warner R Va Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee returned from a trip to Iraq last week and said there might have to be a change in course in three months Baker a skilled Texas political operative had served as chief of staff in the Reagan administration and as Secretary of the Treasury before becoming the nation s chief diplomat in the administration of George Herbert Walker Bush father of the president and Baker s close lifelong friend Baker is well schooled in Middle Eastern politics In his memoir Baker recalled his warning not to take Baghdad and topple Saddam Hussein after the successful Persian Gulf War fearing it would provoke a civil war that would take U S forces a long time to quell For the same reasons the previous President Bush decided against a full scale invasion of Iraq after liberating Kuwait But the current President Bush preferred to take the word of the neocon advisers who told him the invasion of Iraq would be a cakewalk Both Baker and the senior Bush are vindicated in their view by the on going chaos in Iraq But they have not sold the present president who has indicated the war will go on after he has left office On Wednesday Gen Peter Schoomaker the Army s chief of staff said that the army is planning to keep its current level of troops in Iraq through Baker has come through for Bush in the past helping to convince the Supreme Court to halt the Florida vote recount in the presidential election in For his efforts a second Bush won the presidency Meantime U S officials in Baghdad and Washington seem bent on trashing the Iraqi government blaming it for not bringing the aggressive militias under control and indicating Iraqi officials are not up to the job of running the country That s what I call chutzpah We invade and tear up a country install our style of government in Baghdad and then criticize them for weaknesses and mistakes Is that our passport out of Iraq What s more those who play ball with us such as Iraqi Vice President Amir al Hashimi who lost three siblings by assassination this year pay a heavy personal price If Baker s group does not find a way to extricate U S troops from the Iraqi quagmire the American people surely will c Hearst Newspapers Spread the Word lt Prev Next gt Back Subscribe to weekly news

'Whitehern Museum Archives Family Thomas Baker McQuesten Advanced Search Thomas Baker McQuesten Tom Tim Tomity Tomty Jun Jan You do not know what a help and strength you have been to your mother I am so nervous and anxious minded that if you had been anything else but what you are I would certainly have broken down If you had been a lazy good for nothing selfish and unsympathetic it seems to me I would have died for people do die of broken hearts W MCP a Thomas Baker McQuesten was just six years old when his father died in He was physically and mentally robust intelligent athletic handsome and genial He embodied the best hope for the family s return to financial stability therefore Mary concentrated all of the family resources on him Mary s letters to him demonstrate her great affection for him and her dedication to his success She molded his attitudes morals and provided his life s plan She was not as concerned about his health and abilities as she was about Calvin s Tom is always mentioned with pride and affection by all family members Tom was educated at Hamilton Public Schools and graduated from Hamilton Collegiate with honours in English History and Classics He entered the University of Toronto in and distinguished himself by winning the Alexander Mackenzie Scholarship for Political Science in which brought a very small cash prize He was president of his fraternity Zeta Psi and editor of Varsity Tom very nearly won the Rhodes Scholarship in the first year it was offered but it became a political contest and he lost out to another candidate The scholarship would have provided per year and it was a sad blow and disappointment to his mother when he did not win The money would have made a great deal of difference to the family and it was a long time before his mother was able to forget it W W Tom s sister Ruby a teacher continued to send money to Tom to pay for his tuition and his father s former law partner James Chisholm helped him as well He had a variety of summer jobs which often involved physical labour and he grew lean and tough This included work on a cattle boat by which he made his way to England and Scotland to visit the original family home there in He also worked in the lumber c s on the Ottawa River for the summers of and but the danger in this work was kept a secret from his mother W It was a long hard struggle and in April of when Tom was twenty five years of age he was still requiring money from his family for fees and living expenses W After graduation from Osgoode in Tom practiced law at Elk Lake near Cobalt during the silver mining boom He loved the hardy life in the North where he could hike and canoe but the opportunities for success were bleak Thomas s family made many sacrifices for his education and he was twenty seven years of age in before he had a stable income with James Chisholm a member of Tom s father s law firm in Hamilton Tom s initial salary was per year with some prospects of sharing profits as well and his mother soon urged him to press for this increase as well as for a finer looking office W She also stated that it is certainly going to mean a great difference to us however it was also in that Ruby s health expenses began to mount and Edna required medical treatment for mental illness from time to time By Tom was able to give some conditional assurance to his mother and to Calvin that there will be no lack of money but we just have to arrange it W Therefore it was twenty one years from to before Mary and her family were able to feel some relief from the financial pressures Tom became the titular head of the family but Mary continued in control she convinced him to stay in Hamilton and urged him into politics and public works Tom never married but there is some evidence that he was engaged to a Miss Elliott in Toronto His mother did not hear about it except by rumour and Tom finally introduced his mother to Miss Elliott after his graduation from law school in Although Mary did not approve she had to deal more carefully with her son and the relationship continued secretly for some time Miss Elliott attempted to win Mary s approval by commissioning a miniature of Mary to be painted by an artist friend however Mary continued to find fault with it and made it an issue between Tom and Miss Elliott Mary was not one to be seduced so easily and Miss Elliott was no match for her W W Precisely why Mary objected to Miss Elliott is never explained in the letters but it likely has its source in the fact that Thomas had been groomed by his mother to replace his father as the successful lawyer and family provider which would restore the family to its former status Now when Tom had just graduated and was on the brink of becoming their saviour he was considering abandoning them Tom certainly felt his obligation to his mother and sisters to take financial responsibility for their support which he did after he went into law practice but he would not have earned enough money for many years to support a wife as well Mary had already established in her objection to David Ross s marriage to Ruby that it was a disgrace for a man to consider marriage until his duty to his own family had been fulfilled The family especially Ruby had made many sacrifices to pay for Tom s education and he was only now at the age of twenty six beginning to show some promise of providing some financial relief for the family Although there is no direct evidence that Mary actively broke up the relationship it did not come to fruition and Tom continued to fulfill his duties to his family However Thomas was handsome and popular and had other relationships with women but they were very discreet and he never married Best n Both Tom and Calvin preferred to spend their time away from home Although Tom was reluctant to come back home to live he finally determined that the best place for him was Hamilton where he could practice law and enter politics He stated to Calvin It would be almost hopeless for a Liberal to get elected in Toronto I think I would stand a far better chance in Hamilton but then I could not afford to be a stranger there W At the same time the matriarchal pressure was mounting to get him involved in law and politics at home and Mary stated that she hoped that here I may get him interested in some other good works as well as indeed she did W Thomas s career is recounted fully and admirably in John Best s biography Thomas Baker McQuesten Public Works Politics and Imagination and in Roland Barnsley s biography Thomas B McQuesten I direct the reader to these works for a full account of Thomas s political career and accomplishments However I will note a few important events here especially as they relate to his mother s influence Tom was elected vice president of the Hamilton Liberal Club in where John Chisholm was president Tom was then elected to Alderman for the City of Hamilton in which he held until His family encouraged him and c aigned vigorously in his political career In the war of Tom favoured conscription and was determined to join the armed forces He had already served in the Militia during university His mother was adamant that he not go and after much argument he did not enlist In Tom was already thirty two years of age and was the sole support of his family Mary did not support the war and felt the money and the lives could have been used to better advantage in the missionary field She could not risk losing Tom and deplored the loss of the lives of young Canadians and their mothers left to mourn them W She also viewed the war as a male folly and was quite disgusted with the way men do things W Tom proceeded with his mother s urging and full approval to fulfill himself in public works He was an astute politician and a good judge of character and quickly learned how to manage people but he preferred to work behind the scenes taking little credit for himself He formed partnerships with other lawyers politicians engineers architects artists and horticulturalists to effect his plans to beautify the city and the province In this he was reflecting the family s dedication to social reform through city planning beautification and education This late Victorian cultural impulse was known as the Social Gospel and City Beautiful movements Significantly for this study which was originally done as a Ph D thesis under the auspices of McMaster University Thomas McQuesten was instrumental in bringing McMaster University to Hamilton from Toronto Other cities in Ontario were competing for the university throughout the s but the factor that tipped the scales in Hamilton s favour was the offer by the Hamilton Board of Parks Management of which Tom was a member to provide the attractive Westdale site and magnificent landscaped grounds Barnsley The site was turned over to McMaster in The Sunken Garden and Lily Pool was a quiet haven of inspiration for scholars and attracted many visitors until the garden was destroyed for the construction of the McMaster Medical Center Tom viewed McMaster as one of the finest contributions that he and his team were able to accomplish Best We ve never landed such a fish as this Our whole development has been along mechanics lines And the result has been the owners don t live here and Hamilton has become too much a factory town This is the first break toward a broader culture and higher educational development It was sorely needed Did I ever think what a great word university is It has never been let down never become stale or commonplace always dignified and lofty Best Mary s letters in and Reveal her pride in McMaster s growth both as a university and as a park Very large contributions coming in for McMaster nearly the and again C Whidden was amazed at the flowers cannot take any more students In these pursuits Tom had his mother s encouragement and after Tom learned to drive in he took her on many trips to inspect various parks greenhouses and McMaster University and its gardens W W W W W W W Tom served on the Hamilton Board of Parks Management from to Within the first decade by Hamilton had the largest acreage of developed park land and playgrounds in any Canadian city This included Gage Park Cootes Paradise Scott Park King s Forest Park Chedoke Golf Course The Royal Botanical Gardens Rock Gardens and The High Level Bridge posthumously renamed the McQuesten High Level Bridge Tom fulfilled his familial and his public duties admirably His friend and associate on the Parks Board C V Langs summed up Tom s self sacrificing dedication T B McQuesten is a bachelor whose bride is the city parks system Best Tom s sister Hilda acted as his hostess for social and political functions and they were an attractive and charming couple at various functions There is no doubt that Hilda s charm grace and intelligence added to Tom s success and that Mary was extremely proud of them They often received invitations to social functions Tom fell under the influence of Noulan Couchon who was an advocate of The Garden City Movement which was sweeping England and Europe and which viewed parks as the lungs of the city The Spectator Hamilton Dec As well as the influence of his mother and sisters there was a strong feminine content in Tom s work He hired Laurie Dunnington as part of the married team of Dunnington Grubbe who were garden designers and he employed Frances Loring and Florence Wyle as the sculptors for his projects After his mother s death in Tom continued to expand his and his mother s public conservation and beautification vision In the same year he was elected to the Provincial Government and was appointed to the Cabinet with two portfolios Minister of Public Works and Minister of Highways for Ontario In this position he was responsible for the construction of the Queen Elizabeth Highway and other roads the Rainbow Bridge the Blue Water Bridge at Sarnia and the Ivy Lea Bridge at Gananoque He had a strong sense of history and his ministry reconstructed Fort Henry Fort Erie and Fort George and the Martello towers at Kingston Tom was also chairman of the Niagara Parks Commission and oversaw the construction of the Niagara Parkway the Floral Clock the Oakes Garden Theatre Queen Victoria Park Queenston Heights Park and Restaurant as well as the School for Apprentice Gardeners which provided training and graduates for the maintenance of the parks Tom dedicated himself to his family rather than to marriage and children and he devoted his life to public works in education beautification and community improvement Tom was also self effacing and gracious in giving credit to his mother for her encouragement and imagination and he referred to her as his best chum Barnsley Mary s obituary in the Hamilton Herald Dec states Tom s acknowledged indebtedness to his mother as the inspiration for his achievements Mr McQuesten has told of the large part his mother has played in molding his tastes his standards and his plan of life Not the least of her contributions to him was to give him a love for beauty that was large enough to spread out and influence the appearance of a great city Large areas of Hamilton are in the last analysis a reflection of her love for beauty Tom was awarded the Hamilton Citizen of the Year Award which Calvin accepted on his behalf while Tom was ill in hospital with cancer He died on January and is buried in the family plot in Hamilton Cemetery Unlike many politicians Tom did not profit from his political career beyond his salary he was scrupulously honest and when he died he left a modest estate of including his share of Whitehern Best However he and his mother and family left to the world the many beauty spots which are a testament to their lives Regrettably only one of these perpetuates the McQuesten name Thomas Baker McQuesten was also honoured by the Hamilton Public Library in when he was inducted into

'Hiram Baker c and Nancy of Ashe and Macon County North Carolina and Union County Georgia martygrant com Marty and Karla Grant Home What s New Surnames Search Christian Books Help Contact Me Hiram Baker c and Nancy of Ashe and Macon County North Carolina and Union County Georgia Home gt Surnames gt Baker gt Hiram Baker Children Researcher List Register Report A Note about sources How to contact me Home The author Marty Grant is not related to Hiram Baker as far as can be proven It is possible that he is a son or grandson of my ancestor Jacob Baker Hiram Baker was born ca per his age of on the census His second census entry showed him as age or born ca Those match each other pretty closely Other researchers give his birth as for some reason though I don t know the source for that It doesn t match either of his census entries Hiram was born in Ashe Co NC as proven by his census entry The Macon County census taker very helpfully included the county of birth for everyone and not just the state I don t know who Hiram Baker s parents are I have theorized that he was a son of my ancestor Jacob Baker since one of Jacob s daughters also moved to Macon County I have also theorized that Hiram is a son of Thomas Baker since they lived near each other in and Hiram did name his oldest son Thomas Baker Other researchers lists Hiram as a son of Zachariah Baker which is probably based on Hiram living near Zachariah s widow in A note about DNA Test Results A descendant of Hiram Baker via his son Thomas Baker has taken the DNA test His results do not match any other Bakers yet He does not match the Thomas Baker group which is where he should be if Hiram were a son of Thomas He also does not match other descendants of Zachariah Baker though only one is in the test database so far Since there is only one Zachariah descendant in the database and only one Hiram descendant we can t draw any solid conclusions We will know more when there are two or more from each line Additional note The DNA test in question was a marker test which generally isn t enough to go on Apparently it is an match with members of the Thomas Baker group If the test is expanded to or perhaps then we will know more Since we have no real proof of Hiram s parentage some census analysis might help However due to the large number of Bakers in Ashe County census analysis doesn t really help much at all For the census Hiram would have been about years old so he should be enumerated in the under age group born All of the Baker families listed in Ashe County that year had an apparent son that age One of these could be Hiram s father Unfortunately the census taker that year only used initials so it is difficult to know who was who J Baker probably James Baker had three sons that age Z Baker likely Zachariah Baker had one son that age another J Baker still unidentified had five sons that age another J Baker probably John W Baker had two sons that age S Baker likely Samuel Baker had four sons that age M Baker likely Morris Baker bef had one son that age and finally another S Baker likely Solomon Baker had two sons that age As you can see the census does not narrow down the list of possible parents for Hiram Baker for every Baker household in the county that year had at least one son of approximately the same age In Hiram Baker would probably still be home with his parents He should have been enumerated in either the age group born ca or in the age group born ca depending on what his actual birth date was Jacob Baker my ancestor had one apparent son in each of those age groups James Baker had two sons of matching ages Jonathan Baker had three possible matching sons Thomas Baker had one matching son Zachariah Baker had one matching son Elijah Baker had one matching male and John Baker had one matching son Like the census the census does not help narrow down the suspects too much Hiram Baker married Nancy just before in Ashe Co NC George Windes a descendant of Hiram and Nancy thinks Nancy s maiden name may have been Ray He may be correct as Ray was a well known name in Ashe County and that family was associated with some of the other Baker s there However Ralphe Baker another descendant of Hiram says that Nancy was a Saunders I don t know which is correct if either I ve not seen evidence either way Hiram Baker was listed on the census very close to the Thomas Baker family could be his father On this census he was listed as Hiram Jr as there was an older Hiram Baker in the same county a cousin probably who was about years older census analysis based

'Thomas Baker McQuesten Public Works Politics and Imagination by Charles M Johnston Published in Canadian Historical Review Volume Number September To see more articles and book reviews from this and other journals visit UTPJOURNALS online at UTPJOURNALS com Thomas Baker McQuesten Public Works Politics and Imagination JOHN C BEST Hamilton Corinth Press Pp x illus Reviewed by CHARLES M JOHNSTON McMaster University This biography is the first serious attempt to do justice to Thomas Baker McQuesten the Hamilton native who served as minister of highways and public works in Mitchell F Hepburn s controversial Liberal administrations at Queen s Park a half century ago And as the author John C Best makes abundantly clear there is considerable justice to be done But the question immediately arises Why was McQuesten neglected for so long One could speculate that over the years his vindictiveness and remoteness among other flaws paraded out by an author who commendably points to his subject s warts as well as to his more comely features may have made McQuesten a less than appetizing choice for the prospective biographer He may also have proved unpalatable because of his slavish backing of Hepburn a political leader whom many condemned as a crude charlatan and a moral fraud a person hardly fit to be supported by a scion of a leading Hamilton family noted for its devotion to the finer aesthetic things of life Again it may simply have been a matter of a Grit s being considered less than historically worthy and politically correct in the heavy Tory atmosphere that prevailed in Ontario after the Second World War To add to McQuesten s liabilities not only did he fail to win the Liberal leadership after Hepburn withdrew from the scene but his own parliamentary career at Queen s Park came to an abrupt end in the elections that produced George Drew s majority Conservative government At least in the political sense McQuesten ended up as an apparent loser not exactly a front burner subject for the aspiring student of politics Thankfully none of this deterred Best who has performed an important rescue operation for McQuesten and in the process put together a good read as one might expect from a perceptive news executive who plies his trade at a local television station I would put his book in the same league with Neil McKenty s equally lively biography of Hepburn which appeared a quarter century ago Best examines McQuesten s political career at both the local and provincial levels from his aldermanic responsibilities in Hamilton to the organization of Liberal affairs in the city and the province and final ly to his elevation to Hepburn s cabinet after the Grit sweep to power in The author is at pains to point out that politics for McQuesten was only a means to an end an opportunity to acquire the necessary authority and funding to promote his many brain children including the Queen Elizabeth Way that opened in The highways minister we are told was disposed to overlook Hepburn s many blemishes on the grounds that the premier constituted the only hope for safeguarding Liberal fortunes in the province and hence for furnishing the necessary springboard for McQuesten s own cherished projects to beautify the Ontario cityscape and modernize its highway network Was he playing the role of a local Albert Speer The argument however is only partially convincing For all his gentility and supposed aloofness from the political rough and tumble McQuesten appears to have entered fully into the in fighting that frequently disfigured Liberal affairs in Ontario and to have played a major role in the bargaining that led to the selection of party officials and candidates He also shared Hepburn s cordial loathing for Mackenzie King so much so that he saw to it that the prime minister s name did not appear on a commemorative bell lodged in another of his inspirations the Rainbow Bridge carillon at Niagara Falls In any case there is no question that the most compelling sections of the book do in fact deal with McQuesten s varied beautification schemes He sought to enhance urban approaches like Hamilton s northwestern entrance and to provide le and ornamental park space for blighted industrial communities He also oversaw the construction of an imaginatively landscaped version of an Autobahn the aforementioned QEW chaired the work of the Niagara Parks Commission and inspired the planting of floral oases such as the Royal Botanical Gardens in Hamilton The last would not only provide splendid vistas for a citizenry habitually starved of such amenities but ultimately a botanical laboratory for major research As Best demonstrates McQuesten came by all this honestly In the early years of the century he had become infatuated with the international City Beautiful movement and had welcomed ambitious urban planning schemes drafted by outside experts such as Noulan Cauchon all of which shaped his thinking when he became head of Hamilton s Board of Park Management and later the minister of highways The author rightly gives full marks to McQuesten s strong commitment to parks as arcadian retreats and environmental lungs even if much of his imaginative enterprise smacks of the patrician stooping to conquer His otherwise laudable schemes for the multitude might also have been an exercise in what passes for social control particularly in an age ravaged by a crippling depression and stirred by unsettling ideologies of the left always anathema to him and his circle Again it is ironic though typical of his class and generation that while the college educated McQuesten played a vital role in locating McMaster University in Hamilton the first break in a broader culture for the city as he characteristically put it he was quick to suspect professors of being in cahoots with dangerous revolutionaries bent on destroying the world that he held dear For McQuesten the latter included On to Ottawa hunger marchers and those who instigated the bitter CIO strike at the General Motors plant in Oshawa This attractively designed and well illustrated biography is not only readable but scholarly Family papers a wide assortment of archival materials and a variety of newspapers magazines and printed memoirs have been assiduously recruited and deployed to produce an enlightening piece of work All the same some of the entries on secondary sources are too sparse no chapter or page references for ex le and there are some inexplicable bibliographical omissions to name but one John Weaver s history of Hamilton which could have provided helpful and corrective insights And when dealing with political matters Best sometimes confuses an already complicated picture by failing to introduce properly on first mention some of the leading players for ex le Harry C Nixon who beat out McQuesten for the Grit leadership after Hepburn stepped down More seriously he gives insufficient credit to the road builders who came before McQuesten notably Wentworth s expansive agribusinessman Frank C bell Biggs who had served in E C Drury s ill fated Farmers government in the early s But these are comparatively minor criticisms of a welcome study that will clearly benefit students of Ontario politics urban enhancement and regional history ',099
