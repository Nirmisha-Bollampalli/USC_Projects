Search Customer Reviews What s this of people found the following review helpful Military history as it should be written July Reviewer J N Mohlman Barrington RI USA See all my reviews The Franco Prussian War is an unusual conflict in that it is in many ways a study in contrasts Historically it set the stage for two twentieth century conflagrations even as it settled scores from the early nineteenth century Politically it marked the zenith of French national influence and the ascendancy of a united German power Finally militarily it offered the first widespread use of breech loading rifles and modern artillery even as it often languished in the tactics of an earlier age It takes a broad brush to capture all of these elements and in this book Michael Howard has succeeded admirably He has taken an often overlooked conflict and placed it squarely at the crossroads of modern Europe and a new more terrible type of war For while the American Civil War or even the Crimean War is often referred to as the first modern war it is in fact in the Franco Prussian War that we see all the key elements of modern warfare national mobilization citizen soldiers under the guidance of a professional general staff and the ascendancy of industrialization in both transport and new more destructive weapons At the same time newer more insidious developments in the form of guerrilla warfare and the targeting of civilians centers for strategic reasons first make their appearance on a large scale Arising out of French objections to the Prussian selection of the Spanish monarch this war like many before and since arose out of a complete lack of French appreciation for the changes that had overtaken the battlefield While the French had relied on a small professional army the Prussians had adopted a model of mandatory service that allowed them to raise massive reasonably competent forces with unprecedented speed Thus when hostilities broke out the French who had assumed an easy victory were caught on their heels and never regained the initiative Thus from the summer of through the depths of winter and into the story of the Franco Prussian War is the story of the courage of the French soldier being failed utterly by inept leadership It wasn t in the strength of Prussian arms or in the courage of its soldiers that the war was won rather it was in the ability of the centralized Prussian command structure to adapt rapidly to events when their French counterparts were still in the dark that victory was secured Thus while Howard s writing on the actual combat is vivid it is in his appreciation of the fundamentally new Prussian way of war that he is most successful From the king through the Bismarck and Moltke and on down through the rest of the senior command he paints a vivid portrait of Prussian ideals and ambition Conversely he is equally successful at capturing the decrepitude and ineptness of a fragmented French government that lost the war in its opening days and then prolonged it to the never ending suffering of its soldiers long after all hope was lost Likewise along these lines Howard nicely illustrates the increasing conflict that inevitable comes between politicians and the military in an era of total war That said I do have a few minor complaints The first is that Howard almost never translates es from the original French or German and while I was just barely able to muddle through with what I remember from high school and college any one who hasn t been exposed to these languages would certainly be frustrated Secondly as anyone familiar with European politics knows nothing happens in a vacuum and yet Howard spends precious little time discussing the implications of the conflict within the international system of the time Finally while Howard offers many maps they offer little to know information about troop positions and lines of march which leaves the reader flipping back rather than digesting a detailed map at a glance However these are minor complaints about an otherwise eminently successful work Howard has packed a tremendous amount of research into a readable and digestible volume His appreciation of the politics and personalities is matched only by his understanding of the weapons of war and the nature of combat Not only is this a successful history of the Franco Prussian war but also a model of what good history writing should be balanced well researched and above all readable Finally Howard s success elevates the Franco Prussian War to its rightful significance as one of the root causes of the tensions that led to WWI and hence to WWII Thus the student of history should appreciate this work not just for its success in considering immediate events but for providing a bridge from the Great Power politics of the nineteenth century to the wars of the twentieth Jake Mohlman Comment Was this review helpful to you Report this of people found the following review helpful The French Military Debacle of January Reviewer Timothy J Graczewski tgraczewski Burlingame CA United States See all my reviews It seems in retrospect as though fate had decided that there should be no humiliation which the French army should be spared That one sentence accurately captures the tenor of Michael Howard s masterful history of the Franco Prussian War First published in and representing Howard s debut as a military historian his history of the stunning Prussian victory over the heavily favored French has stood the test of time and rightfully confirmed his place as one of the preeminent historians of war in the twentieth century Howard tells the story of the war primarily from the French perspective and it is a stinging indictment of that country s political and military system at that time Disgraced French commanders such as Bazaine or Bourbaki are more pitied by Howard than criticized for their performance He argues that primary fault for the disasters that befell the French armies were more the product of a defective French military system that put such incompetent men in command of large armies rather than the fault of the incompetent commanders themselves Only occasionally does Howard divert his attention to the Prussian side and when he does it is most often to discuss the friction generated between Moltke and Bismark or to describe the usually quick and effective Prussian reaction to halting or diffident French moves However Howard seems to place no stock in the notion of a German genius for war For instance he is quick to point out the many mistakes Moltke s army made particularly in the early days of the conflict and notes that more often than not the French troops gave just as good as they got in open battles with the Germans In many ways the Franco Prussian War marked the culmination of the dramatic military reforms begun by Scharnhorst after the disastrous defeat at the hands of Napoleon at the Battle of Jena in Prussian improvements in military recruitment training and organization and most notably the development of a General Staff responsible for managing the immense requirements of modern war were all brought to bear on the French and in many accounts is credited with the stunning victory Howard recognizes the revolutionary implications of the railroad telegraph and rifled weaponry and also notes the decisive influence Prussian military planning and organization had in the conflict Indeed he notes that the war was a watershed event in military history On the one hand the conflict included perhaps the last successful cavalry charge in history as well as the final employment of Vauban s time honored siegecraft techniques developed in the th century Yet the war also held some harbingers of future warfare such as the deliberate bombardment of civilian populations at Strasburg and Paris in an attempt to undermine civilian morale and storm troop tactics developed to minimize casualties in attacking positions defended by troops with rapid firing rifled weaponry Nevertheless in the final analysis Howard seems to credit the French more with defeat than the Prussians with victory Finally it should be noted there are a lack of adequate c aigns maps which makes many portions of the book difficult to follow Comment Was this review helpful to you Report this Customer Reviews Average Customer Review Write an

enough about the Franco Prussian War to criticize the research and the facts presented But this is certainly not an enjoyable book to read If that is a factor for you be warned Comment Was this review helpful to you Report this of people found the following review helpful Boring but informative May Reviewer George Dimitriou georgestuff mays landing nj United States See all my reviews I actually have not finished the book yet so forgive my hypocrisy From an information and accuracy perspective it is probably the best book on the war However it is a bit of a tough read so be prepared Howard details technology and warfare of the time along with politics and the like and the book doesn t miss much However perhaps that is the reason it seems so long overall I would say a good book Comment Was this review helpful to you Report this of people found the following review helpful an authoritative treatment of a complex conflict September Reviewer doc peterson Portland Oregon USA See all my reviews Howard does a masterful job in detailing the the military preparations of both sides before the conflict describing the war itself and even going into some detail about the increasing importance of technology in modern warfare especially transport However there are some shortcommings the chief among them are the maps While they are useful in giving the reader an idea of what happened where they really needed to be more detailed showing troop movements and positions I also thought the lack of perspective on the war was disappointing after all the Franco Prussian war was instrumental in the creation of German nationhood the birth of the Fourth republic and a foundation stone of the First World War None of these important after effects were discussed in any detail whatsoever As a book of pure military history though Howard s book is beyond reproach Comment Was this review helpful to you Report this of people found the following review helpful Brisk and Detailed April Reviewer michael McKinney TX United States See all my reviews This is a very detailed account of the military and to a lesser extent political maneuverings of the Franco Prussian War Given the detail and the heavy footnoting it is a surprisingly brisk read though I do have one suggestion to assist future readers photocopy the various pages that have maps on them so you can easily refer to them as you read on Since I hadn t thought of this idea while reading the book I found myself holding two or even three such pages open with the fingers of my left hand while reading battle descriptions many many pages later One disappointment was in the very brief epilogue The author discusses how the speed of the Prussian victory raised the stakes for all European powers Germany in particular but the author does not really discuss the aftermath of the war in France or explain how France formed a post war government given the fractious way it had fought the war Every history needs to stop at some point of course but a brief explanation of France s recovery seems in order Comment Was this review helpful to you Report this See all customer reviews Customer Discussions Beta
