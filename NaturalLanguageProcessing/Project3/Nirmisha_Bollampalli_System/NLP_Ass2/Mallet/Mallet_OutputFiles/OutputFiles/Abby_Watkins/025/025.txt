CP Seven teens on a high school ski excursion in the back country of east central B C died Saturday when a half kilometre wide avalanche came down from above them and engulfed their group It was the second deadly slide to hit the region in as many weeks Seven adults perished in a slide in January The dead were six boys and one girl all in Grade at Strathcona Tweedsmuir School a private day school on an expansive rural c us in the foothills southwest of Calgary We are absolutely stricken with grief Our hearts go out to all those who are impacted Tony Macoun head of the school said in a written statement Frantic parents gathered at the school Saturday night arriving separately and in groups embracing each other No students were visible Our school is a small family and loss this extreme is impacting us tremendously said Macoun There were people in the school group three adults and Grade students in an outdoor education class on their annual cross country ski trip The avalanche occurred on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park just before noon said Pam Doyle superintendent for Parks Canada in Revelstoke It happened on the north face of the mountain in Connaught Creek Valley section of Balu Valley about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit The group was led by two male teachers and a male volunteer All had certification and back country experience Macoun said The group had been skiing about metres apart with one supervisor in front and the other two bringing up the rear The skiers were halfway up the valley when the avalanche roared down the north slope burying nearly the entire group Another group of young skiers witnessed the avalanche and were among the first to help A supervisor whose hand was just visible above the snow was the first to be dug out Once freed he called park wardens on a satellite phone to raise the alarm Of the remaining students six of the students are safe and one has a broken ankle Macoun said in his statement The three leaders were uninjured and are attending to the survivors who were in Revelstoke on Saturday night after being airlifted first to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter Two people from the group were treated for minor injuries said RCMP Sgt Randy Brown The avalanche was very powerful with a rating from to compared with a top rating of said Pat Dunn a Parks Canada spokeswoman The size to avalanche could destroy a building or acres of forest she said The slide was to metres wide and travelled a kilometre down the slope Some of the skiers were buried as deep as three metres said Dunn She said the group was carrying the proper avalanche rescue equipment including personal locator beacons and digging tools A park conditions bulletin said there was a considerable avalanche hazard in the area Saturday That rating is about the middle of the hazard scale but includes the high probability that a person could trigger a slide said Dunn The risk always varies when the risk is posted as considerable it s a note to skiers to be cautious she said There are a couple of instabilities in our snow pack this winter that may have contributed and further investigation will determine that Saturday s slide was unusually deadly said Eric Dafoe public safety officer with Parks Canada in Revelstoke We ve never had an avalanche like this where we had a multiple number of people buried said Dafoe who worked on the rescue effort and flew over the slide as part the initial investigation It was a huge slide he said It covered the valley floor from side to side Dafoe said the slide began at a point between to vertical metres up Mount Cheops It travelled for a kilometre and spread out half a kilometre at the sides The toe of the slide ended at about the metre elevation mark with parts of it more than five metres deep Dafoe said the investigation will continue but was almost certain it was a natural slide It the slide trigger site is so far from the bottom it seems unlikely it was human triggered he said Dafoe speculated a small slide may have occurred high up the mountain and as it came down it dragged out snow from surrounding gullies Park wardens RCMP officers and local ski tour operators and guides backed up by four or five helicopters and search dogs joined in the rescue effort Members of a Canadian Horse Artillery unit stationed in the park for avalanche control work were also on hand to assist Ruedi Beglinger owner of Selkirk Mountain Experience and organizer of the fatal expedition last month was with his clients when it struck Contacted Saturday night Beglinger did not want to comment on the level of experience necessary to ski the area where the students were caught There is an inherent risk in back country skiing which is very important to talk about an inherent risk people have to be willing to share amongst themselves whether they have a guide or not he said The area of Saturday s slide is not particularly remote but Dunn said there were no groomed trails except people who have been there before you But no guides are needed to ski in the area and skiers do not have to register before setting off It s a very very popular ski destination site said Dunn media liaison officer at the national park Brown said the skiers were not part of a commercial tour group Doyle said that at this time there are no plans yet to close back country areas of the park Official Reports Avalanche Tragedy in Glacier National Park by Doreen McGillis Parks Canada Published in the Avalanche News of the Canadian Avalanche Association On February a huge avalanche swept into the Connaught Creek drainage of Glacier National Park and into the awareness of millions of Canadians This avalanche accident attracted the attention of the nation The seven victims of this avalanche were year olds on a school field trip and the accident happened less than two weeks after an avalanche that killed seven skiers in an area only kilometres away All skiers in the school group were caught in this avalanche either partially or fully buried and survived Two Association of Canadian Mountain Guides ACMG members were above this party heard and saw the avalanche across the valley and tried to warn the group but the avalanche hit them so fast they were unable to get to safety The rescuers Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall immediately skied down to the slide area and started to dig out those buried The first person that they dug out called for help on his satellite phone which mobilized a large rescue team Then as members of the group were freed from the slide they helped dig out the others Upon hearing the number of people who were caught in this avalanche the rescuers wondered how so many could be involved Their answer came when they flew to the scene of the avalanche It was huge The fracture zone was about metres wide and the run out was more than a kilometre long The size of the rescue operation was also huge more than people seven helicopters six avalanche dogs and their handlers and dozens of support staff were involved This was a multi agency rescue involving Parks Canada staff from three national parks several local companies Selkirk Tangiers Helicopter Skiing Canadian Mountain Holidays Selkirk Mountain Experience Alpine Helicopters Kokanee Helicopters Shell Canada Revelstoke Executive Flight Services mountain guides RCMP tourists medical staff and the Canadian Army stationed at Rogers Pass Important services provided during the rescue included grief counseling support to the families media relations transportation and logistical support Participating in such a difficult situation is very stressful It is tragic that seven young people lost their lives in the accident and the people of Revelstoke and Golden have shared this grief The speedy rescue helped save the lives of the remaining people in the group and to quickly recover the victims The credit for the speed and efficiency of the entire rescue effort can be shared among all of those who participated in this rescue Times such as these show how public safety professionals and volunteers truly rise to the occasion when called upon The staff and management of Mount Revelstoke and Glacier National Parks would like to offer our gratitude and appreciation to all of the individuals who took part in the rescue efforts following the tragic avalanche of February Steve
