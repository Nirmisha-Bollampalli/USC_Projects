Clan Hunter Clan Hunter As is typical with anyone of Scottish descent I could likely claim any number of Clans as my own I have chosen Clan Hunter for the simple and pragmatic reason that my nearest antecedent from Scotland was Jane Hunter I am still only dabbling in searching that family line I ll have more time when I retire right What I know thus far is that she and her parents James Hunter and Margaret Allen Hunter left Greenoch and arrived in New Brunswick in settling at Perry Point Kings County Later on in that same year she married John Tenpenny Murphy in St John I can only surmise what brought Jane and her parents to the New World there was famine in Scotland in those years and there had been several epidemics of typhus and cholera I have also heard they being weavers did not like those new mechanized looms Luddites Meanwhile if you are a Hunter or a Murphy and some of your ancestors settled in New Brunswick perhaps we can compare notes I will soon have my Hunter genealogy family history posted here At Hunterston Castle in West Kilbride Ayrshire Scotland there is an ancient charter signed by seal of King Robert II the Bruce s grandson first in the line of the House of Stewart granting the lands to William Hunter the th Laird on May The earliest record of Hunters in Scotland dates back to where reference is made to William Hunter the st Laird being a witness to the Inquisition of King David I King David I would have invited Normans to join him in Scotland friends to aid him in ruling an unruly kingdom as David grew up in the Norman courts The name Hunter does derive from the occupation of our original kinsmen but it implies much more As you will note by the Clan Crest there is a coronet around the dog s neck signifying a royal connection apparently our ancestor was excellent at his craft having been appointed the Chief Hunter in Scotland by King David The charter and a replica of the Hunterston Brooch displayed at Hunterston Castle The original brooch was found in during excavations It is a stunning ex le of th century craftsmanship combining Celtic and Anglo Saxon designs It is inches in diameter made of silver partially gilded inset with gold and studded with amber The original is on display in the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland in Edinburgh The tartan background on this site is the current Hunter tartan Madame Pauline Hunter of Hunterston th Laird More pictures of Hunterston Castle here Here I am representing Clan Hunter at the Western Massachusetts Highland Games and Celtic Festival June The gentleman sitting in the tent is Steve May a good friend of mine whose company InKeeper hosts this site and the WMass Games website He traveled all the way from West Virginia with his new bride Deb to share the day This was my first time out representing the Clan at a games and I had a great time doing so The Association was extremely helpful in calming my nerves and getting tent supplies to me in a timely fashion I plan on doing it again next year Clan Hunter Links The official website for Clan Hunter Association USA Tom Hunter who is the President of Clan Hunter Association Canada has a comprehensive site There is Clan Hunter merchandise and information on ordering The Gathering of the Clans has Clan Hunter pages including a discussion forum Heather s Hunter page which includes links to other Hunter sites Hunter genealogy message board Electric Scotland has a webboard system for hundreds of clans including Clan Hunter This site is a member of WebRing To browse visit here All suggestions for other Hunter links welcome I have created a OneList community for Clan Hunter Please join the email list set up exclusively for us Click to subscribe to HunterClan The above link will bring you to the eGroups site If you want to jump right in and subscribe then Subscribe to HunterClan Powered by www egroups com Thanks
