CBC CA The National Worst case scenario Avalanche kills seven teens in B C backcountry Reporter Margo McDiarmid February On February seven Calgary families learned of the deaths of their teenage children and an entire country grieved with them Scott Broshko Marissa Staddon Ben Albert Daniel Arato Alex Patillo Michael Shaw and Jeff Trickett were killed during a high school ski trip swept to their deaths by a massive avalanche It was an unimaginable tragedy both for the parents who saw their children off that fateful day and for the people who tried desperately to rescue them It all started on a Friday morning in a Calgary parking lot Three teachers and students embarked on the school trip they had been looking forward to backcountry skiing Scott Broshko Donna Broshko s son Scott was among the group They were just so excited and happy to go she says It sounded like they were just going to have the time of their lives It was just another one of the trips right You know it was Have fun Love you You know that kind of stuff right But never I wasn t really ever thinking any grave potential danger I mean trust me if it would ve been you know mama bear would ve never let him go A young Marissa Staddon Karl Staddon described his daughter Marissa Marissa was bubbly and upbeat and she had on her red bibbed ski pants and had on her Gore Tex red Gore Tex top and her green pack and we drove over to the Canadian Tire on Richmond Road he said I got to tell you that my wife when we left our house she stood at the doorway to the garage and was very concerned and was tearing up because of just concerns about safety he said Marissa gave me a big hug and nestled her head against my neck and said Dad I love you And I said Marissa I love you too And I said have a great trip And that was the last time I saw her alive The skiers went to British Columbia s Glacier National Park one of the most popular places in the world for backcountry adventure Enthusiasts can trek up trails into the steep mountains and bowls of untouched snow It s a skier s paradise It s also avalanche country The students and their teachers knew that and trained for it What they didn t know was that they were about to ski into the worst case scenario Marissa gave me a big hug and nestled her head against my neck and said Dad I love you Rick Marshall Saturday morning was day two of the trip and the group headed up a popular trail into a mountain valley There were a number of other skiers in the area that day Rick Marshall was one of them I think it was probably around or something like that when we left the car and headed up the Connaught Creek drainage he said And we were you know there s a few people ahead of us we realized on the trail and you know we started passing a few groups and some groups were going off into another drainage to ski and they came across the school group and passed them he said We just started off from our break We noticed an avalanche coming down off the north face of Mount Cheops and that s when we realized that there was you know a good group of skiers was below in the path of it he said We actually yelled to them that there was an avalanche coming down off of Cheops said Marshall We actually witnessed the avalanche hit a couple of the front members of the group Abby Watkins Abby Watkins also saw the avalanche Within seconds I had the realization that it was going to be very big she said I had a question as to whether we were safe because we were straight across from it And then we just braced for what was going to happen And then we were hit by the powder cloud said Watkins Right off the bat I could see that there were people caught in it said Marshall And then you know I saw a hand sticking out and you know a leg further over and somebody partially buried There was little chance that I could save everybody said Watkins You just have to save as many people as possible There was little chance that I could save everybody said Watkins You just have to save as many people as possible Within an hour seven helicopters people and three search dogs were on the scene But Rick Marshall got there first I went to the person with the hand sticking out he said That just happened to be Andrew the group leader and he had a cellphone on him not a cellphone but a satellite phone and so we radioed Parks personnel Eric Dafoe Eric Dafoe was avalanche rescue commander that day I got the call from dispatch in Rogers Pass and said you re going to work he said My initial reaction was this is really serious and we ve got to act quickly Dafoe met Jordy Shepherd an avalanche site rescue leader and they flew to the scene by helicopter This was our worst case scenario said Shepherd A large natural avalanche in a busy area that hit a large group That type of dry slab avalanche can generally reach speeds of to kilometres an hour and it actually pushes a pillow of wind in front of it Sylvain Hebert Sylvain Hebert a heli ski guide and rescuer was skiing nearby at the time of the avalanche I had just been dropped off on top of a run and I d skied maybe turns and I got a call on the radio from our radio dispatch telling me that there was an avalanche at Rogers Pass and that they needed our help he said I just grabbed the shovel and shovelled as well Jordy Shepherd Shepherd and Dafoe credit a number of guides including Hebert Marshall and Watkins with rescuing several of the victims Watkins and Marshall were probably responsible for saving five people s lives said Dafoe Marshall said he had no choice but to act quickly A slide that powerful and with that kind of snow density you know you only have five minutes he said There were no air pockets in the snow You re just holding your breath Marshall said some victims were conscious and some were not In a situation like that you just you give er and you don t stop he said You re on adrenalin and you know you dig hard and you search hard and you just try and get the job done as fast as you can Watkins said it was difficult to deal with the fact that some of the teens weren t alive when they got to them Every face I saw like that I realized that there was a family attached that this was going to devastate that family she said As the rescue progressed the winds picked up and conditions turned dangerous Marshall said he and the other rescuers worried another avalanche would hit them We were a little concerned you know why this avalanche started he said The winds were a little higher now and we were concerned for our own safety as well The rescuers beat an orderly retreat Our world had stopped Donna Broshko remembered how she heard about the avalanche I m going out the back way out the garage door and the phone rings and it s the headmaster from school and he said Donna there s been an accident I said OK well is everybody okay And he says Oh no unfortunately not I say well what do you mean unfortunately not Or something like that And he said Well there s been some fatalities And he says Oh there s been such a tragedy And I was like cut to the chase Like I ve had enough waiting Like I just no more peripheral stuff like just tell me how Scott is He says I m really sorry he s one of the victims Well that was like it was like phenomenal It was like like just such disbelief Just no no Just no Just no Karl Staddon Karl Staddon also got the call I asked for the RCMP s number in Revelstoke which he provided to me he said And so I called and I spoke with Officer Sommerville who also was very gracious And he I told him who I was I was the father of one of the students involved in the trip I understand there s been an avalanche and wondered if he could fill me in And then he paused and he said you should brace yourself for the worst possible outcome And my heart about leapt out of my chest And then he went on to say and again with great compassion and care he said that there are nine students that are accounted for or alive and accounted for Your daughter is not on that list But we cannot say with per cent certainty that she s deceased at this stage he said We were numbed to be honest said Staddon Truly numbed Just could not believe it Our world had stopped Janice Pinkerton As the families struggled to cope with the tragedy Revelstoke resident Janice Pinkerton a member of Revelstoke Victims Services opened her home to the survivors A lot of them had bangs in their faces and their ears and they didn t look like they had been they were wounded but they were definitely hurt she said And they talked about hotels and that and that didn t strike me that struck me wrong So I said that I had a house that was more than big enough and I m sure I could find enough blankets and sleeping bags and beds and they could sleep there she said The memory I ll have is their faces their ears because they had a lot of them had like swollen faces she said And how they huddled How they were always together And they it was almost like they moved as a group and I thought that that was that was very powerful to me that they were so so focused on each other she said In Calgary normal life stopped Seven funerals in less than a week The city ran out of flowers Donna Broshko At her son Scott s funeral Donna Broshko carried his ashes in an urn I thought I m his mother I carried him for nine months I can carry him out I can do this you know And I did it I just I can do this right It s something you can do for your child right Karl Staddon reflected on the funeral for his daughter Marissa When I wrote the funeral card I looked at some of the other cards and you know people live to be or and years seemed so incredibly short he said And I did the math and Marissa was with us for days That sounded better And they were glorious days Strathcona Tweedsmuir School launched an investigation into the tragic school trip and it is reviewing its outdoor education program that is the cornerstone of the private school s philosophy In the meantime all other school trips are cancelled Donna Broshko says she doesn t blame the school for her son s death In my heart I believe that they did do everything that they could do you know Sometimes things happen in life right Sometimes things happen in life right Staddon agrees I m at peace with the decision making by the trip leaders that particular day he said And I m satisfied that this is a very rare occurrence of this magnitude that involved a school group Jordy Shepherd said that the group did everything right This group was they were very well prepared and and it was an unfortunate circumstance that they were they were there at that time he said But the four seconds that wiped out seven young lives will leave lasting scars not just on the school and the families but also on the people who fought to save the skiers and the B C community that poured its heart out to the survivors Watch part one of Margo McDiarmid s report runs Watch part two of Margo
