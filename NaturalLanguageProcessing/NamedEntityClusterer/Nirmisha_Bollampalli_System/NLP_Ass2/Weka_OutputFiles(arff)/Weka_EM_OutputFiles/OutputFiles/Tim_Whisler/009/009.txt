Bruce Brother s Column Bruce Brothers Staff Writer St Paul Pioneer Press FANS hour road race I was talking to someone after the June FANS hour road race and commented I feel like I lost a day of my life Immediately I corrected myself No I said I just put the world on hold for a day In joining Ed Rousseau Sue Olsen Danny Ripka and about others for a foot race that began at a m on a Saturday and continued until a m Sunday I was immersed in a physical netherworld where I half felt I could leap tall buildings in a single bound and half felt I should check directly into a mortuary Doing FANS was surely one of life s peak experiences But as any marathon runner or Ironman triathlete or American Birkebeiner skier knows the uninitiated just don t get it A young massage therapist named Kirsten was working on my tight quadriceps muscles about nine hours into the race and couldn t stop herself from asking the obvious Why The Minnesota Sports Massage Therapy Team volunteers its services for the FANS race setting up tables and staffing them in rotating shifts in the shade of two gigantic elm trees a few feet from the serpentine shoreline of Lake Nokomis Along with a contingent of friendly Army reservists and dozens of selfless folks who donate their efforts to keep the runners going the workers at the massage tables p ered us almost until we were embarrassed The most common question we heard out there Is there anything you need When was the last time someone asked you that around the house or workplace I had no immediate concise response for Kirsten I asked her why she hauls her table over to Lake Nokomis on a sunny Saturday afternoon and spends four hours massaging sweaty strangers for free I love what I do she said and it s for a good cause Well there you have at least a tiny part of the equation We love what we do and the Family Advocate Network System is a worthy cause It raises money to help keep inner city kids away from drugs and pregnancies and to send them to college Runners and walkers at this year s race boosted the FANS treasury by more than Many take their fund raising seriously Les Martisko posted a sign by his tent where his wife Cindy changed the lap number and amount of cash raised after every circuit of the mile course around Nokomis Martisko who lives in Burnsville piled up miles and collected in pledges Several raised much more But it s not just the charity or a love of running that draws us to Nokomis on the often steamy first weekend of summer There s a camaraderie I told Kirsten Also it s a huge challenge As I read somewhere life begins at the edge of your comfort zone Later as I was running with a good friend who traveled a long way simply to help keep me motoring and motivated for several hours the conversation turned philosophical People who do this kind of thing are real I told her Honesty and respect accompany the ceaseless miles the sameness of the terrain and the sharing of a sunset and a sunrise with like minded individuals There s no fakery Age and gender become irrelevant A bond forms as miles and laps pile up one step at a time For ex le I was playing leapfrog with Ed Rousseau for a while at about o clock in the morning Ed who at can outrun athletes half his age at any distance from kilometers to miles is a legend at FANS Ten times in the years of this race he has earned the coveted sweat shirt that proclaims he has run miles in a day A recovering alcoholic who lives within a short jog of Lake Nokomis Ed would be a good person to see if you re looking for inspiration Three members of Alcoholic Anonymous approached Ed at different times in and asked him to draw up programs to help them run their first marathons He did and last October he encountered each of them near the starting line of the Twin Cities Marathon All three had expressed doubts that they could complete the miles of a marathon Rousseau recalled Well like me they switched their addiction to running and there they were he said Because of the anonymity of AA he doesn t know their last names and couldn t check the results to see if they finished I strongly suspect they did he said Some day in some meeting I ll bump into them and have a happy reflection on their first marathon Rousseau said has great pride in his personal accomplishments but added It s the special people moments that provide me that inner feeling of reward At FANS this year in the middle of the night Ed was running hard for two or three minutes then walking for to seconds I asked him to explain his unique five hours to go strategy If I run harder he said it s easier to push through the pain barrier than when I m running at one slower pace for a long time Whatever works For me revival came after two extended breaks and a minute nap Rousseau had miles to go before he slept He racked up this year giving him an astonishing miles in years of FANS Only Sue Olsen has more Olsen is a world class ultramarathon runner from Burnsville who became infamous for running Grandma s Marathon five years ago in Duluth Minn when she was months pregnant She came back a week later to run kilometers at FANS when it was staged at Lake Harriet one day before giving birth to a healthy son she and her husband named John Miles John was serenaded with a zealous rendition of Happy Birthday at this year s FANS awards brunch Olsen runs away with the women s division of FANS nearly every year and won the overall title in This year Elizabeth Fischer Drew of Minnetonka was breathing down Sue s neck totaling a personal best miles Olsen went These people are real encouraging and humble and spirited and friendlier than Bill Rodgers at a race expo You want real How about Dan and Nancy Berdan or Jay and Jamie Honeycutt or Bob Metzger and Chris Markham married couples who celebrate their union by training together and then running around a lake for hours Or Jon Drew Pat Ripka Gene Curnow and Carol Zazubek who celebrate their marriages by nursing and prodding their spouses for hours while the applause went to the spouses Or Gordon Chase Bob Skomars Tom Wade and Tim Whisler who sacrificed a day of their lives just to help friends and acquaintances keep going Real How about ageless Burt Carlson who at ran his th FANS and knocked off miles without losing his smile Or Danny Ripka who just three weeks after reaching miles in a hour track race in France accumulated miles at FANS to finish second overall Ripka and Olsen who won the women s division of that race in France with miles typify the definition of motivation Both were so spent after the race Sunday morning they hobbled and wobbled into a restaurant for the awards brunch Ripka the FANS record holder who s as intense during a race as a sprinter in the blocks explained it this way I just give it all I ve got Olsen on the other hand soft pedals her goals and distributes smiles to everyone But if someone pulls close to her in mileage a fire lights in her eyes and pain and fatigue become secondary in importance Spectators and friends look at Danny Ripka and Sue Olsen with awe But at FANS you don t have to be a front runner Those of us or miles behind the leaders near the end of hours receive the same looks of admiration and wonder It s a special moment in a day of special moments Does that answer your question Kirsten Bruce Brothers recreation column appears
