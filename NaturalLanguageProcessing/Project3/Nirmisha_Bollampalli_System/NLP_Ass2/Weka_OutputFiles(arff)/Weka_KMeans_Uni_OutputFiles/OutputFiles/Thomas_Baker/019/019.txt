September in Estill Co Kentucky Thomas made his will the day before he died listing children Jacob Baker the heirs of Joseph Baker Humphrey Baker William Baker the heirs of Thomas Baker Jr and

where acres was surveyed for Humphrey on April on Stalnakers Creek today s Hutton Creek near the present town of Glade Spring The land which lay on both sides of the creek included the path over Walker Mountain to the North fork of the Holston and beyond and northwest of Stalnaker who had settled on Indian fields in This made Humphrey the western most settler at the time Stalnaker only had a lease to crop for his trading post settlement Historian J Allen Neal in his bicentennial history of Washington County Virginia incorrectly concluded that the Stalnaker settlement was west of that of Baker that Hutton Creek was Stalnaker s Creek and Baker s Creek was the stream that follows the Smyth Washington County line Actually Stalnaker s Creek Baker s Creek and the present day Hutton s Creek are one and the same depending on which period of history is being considered The survey from patents and deeds confirm it For many years after the Baker settlement was the farthest outpost of the frontier Thomas served as a member of the Bedford Co Virginia militia at the height of the first phase of the French and Indian War in He received pay in for his services as a soldier at Fort Fauquier on the James River as a member of Col John Buchanan s Company He was a member as was his father of Capt Alexander Sayer s Troop of Horse Company Thomas along with his father Humphrey and family
