at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty at Saipan Mariana Islands June to July When his entire company was held up by fire from automatic weapons and small arms fire from strongly fortified enemy positions that commanded the view of the company Sgt then Pvt Baker voluntarily took a bazooka and dashed alone to within yards of the enemy Through heavy rifle and machinegun fire that was directed at him by the enemy he knocked out the strong point enabling his company to assault the ridge Some days later while his company advanced across the open field flanked with obstructions and places of concealment for the enemy Sgt Baker again voluntarily took up a position in the rear to protect the company against surprise attack and came upon heavily fortified enemy pockets manned by officers and enlisted men which had been bypassed Without regard for such superior numbers he unhesitatingly attacked and killed all of them Five hundred yards farther he discovered men of the enemy who had concealed themselves behind our lines and destroyed all of them On July the perimeter of which Sgt Baker was a part was attacked from sides by from to Japanese During the early stages of this attack Sgt Baker was seriously wounded but he insisted on remaining in the line and fired at the enemy at ranges sometimes as close as yards until his ammunition ran out Without ammunition and with his own weapon battered to uselessness from hand to hand combat he was carried about yards to the rear by a comrade who was then himself wounded At this point Sgt Baker refused to be moved any farther stating that he preferred to be left to die rather than risk the lives of any more of his friends A short time later at his request he was placed in a sitting position against a small tree Another comrade withdrawing offered assistance Sgt Baker refused insisting that he be left alone and be given a soldier s pistol with its remaining rounds of ammunition When last seen alive Sgt Baker was propped against a tree pistol in hand calmly facing the foe Later Sgt Baker s body was found in the same position gun empty with Japanese lying dead before him His deeds were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U S Army Citation Courtesy of www HomeOfHeroes com Medal Of Honor Special Sections History Statistics of the MOH Individual Citations Photos Of Recipients The Living
