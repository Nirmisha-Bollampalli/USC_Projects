being taught well enough in college Security Posted by The Channel Team Thu Aug AM Michael Howard Microsoft s top security official notes that many college graduates need to get remedial security training Tags Security Media Length Replies Views Jeremy W that blogging guy Tue Apr PM I agree completely Colleges are teaching a lot more about business priorities These are generally rooted in the convenience vs security balance but approached purely from a business sense Which is good but because the balanced isn t being maintained you have whole roles being defined around security which is good but again it s extreme because the balance is so far off jcfiala Self Portrait Tue Apr PM Huh never thought about it but yeah while I was at CMU admittedly ten years ago security was never brought up as something to worry about in any classes Now I m finding it rather facinating john murph Tue Apr PM You think you ve got it bad I finished my Computing degree nearly years ago I ve worked mostly for small companies on teeny dev teams ever since training is all about how good I am at picking stuff up as I go along If I were to disappear off at a tangent I know I should blog it there s a large group that s seldom well catered for Scoble was discussing how easy it is to blow one s conference budget a while back yet I exist in a world where the notion of conference budget doesn t even make it to the level of theoretical concept one does slightly better on training budget in that at least its acknowledged as not existing I feel better now vanlandw Wed Apr AM My college had an elective course System Security Tought with linux machines and pretty much we learned basic hacking techniques Then the second half of the course was implementing what we learned to a box and try to keep hackers out of our machines Very intersting to learn how a WHOIS and a HOST command can really screw up a machine adwb mm Wed Apr AM I know quite a few people who have been hired recently by Microsoft from WWU my current location of study and I happen to know that the security courses are few and far between Being a computer science student here at WWU has made me realize that this is not the place I want to continue my education The instructors don t seem interested in what they teach and the selection of courses is very focused on doing good math using a dated programming language I have to say that I have had one instructor who is very interested in security and writing quality code Coincidentally he teaches only one class per quarter and runs a local software company during the day I d go as far as to say he s not even a real professor So that reduces the number of excellent security instructors to nill at WWU nasserd Wed Apr PM My inaugural post to Channel hoorah I ve been on the software side of things for almost a decade now however only left college barely years ago From what I ve seen from the insides of schools public private ivy quasi ivy non ivy Tier and Tier whose curriculums I ve investigated here s a shortlist of their courses Whiz bang animation courses OOP using Java now more with C NET EE approaches to software dev t Starting a software biz n tier system how they work Very little has anything to do with security When the CS graduates look for jobs they say wait they can do that Or Naw that s not what I was taught Okay enough ramble Long story short students barely know what to look for and schools as always rely on student interests to build a popular field of study In the end as was previously mentioned since schools don t know what to offer and don t know who can teach it the students are unable to learn And the vicious cycle makes another round timothyblek bah Wed Apr PM My first poast as well I think alot of what is taught in schools comes from teaching to the lowest common denominator I participate on an advisory board every year at the local community college where I also teach part time This year I came across something interesting We basically ran into two schools of thought teach basic classes to get the high school kids up and running with computer and programming classes and on to a good year or jr programming job teach really cool but very advanced classes on security mostly network though knowing that we re going to be catering to businesses out there educating their employees though our certificate programs Obviously teaching Hello World isn t as sexy or fun as an advanced class on securing a Linux firewall so competent teachers want to have the fun courses Ultimately schools must make money though or they can t pay us teachers so the fresh meat get the basic programming classes not exciting at all mostly because it is a struggle to fill these student s heads with good programming practices and we spend a large portion of time just with flow control and the concepts of OOP That leaves the middle ground a sort of no man s land At what point is it appropriate to introduce a programmer to security concepts Before or after they learn what a switch statement is Before or after they learn to connect to a database Also look at the job postings today people are asking for things like a year of C years RDMS years OOP I have very rarely seen a request for something like year secure programming experience anduril Tue Jun PM I m not a programmer well not outside of being a hobbyist I enjoy doing some programming on the side in my free time so of course I m not going to be taught how to write secure code They re interested in attempting to pass a decent amount of us students who couldn t code if their lives depended on it Granted my school does offer quite a few security courses that don t focus on writing secure code but rather creating a secure system enviroment network what not I m an IST major not CS ryanlowe Wed Jun PM You will be happy to know that the Software Engineering program at the University of Ottawa has a required security course for all fourth year students It was quite comprehensive covering threat modelling encryption digital signatures I very much enjoyed going to the class and the content was very interesting I agree that generally developers are either ignorant or don t care enough about security issues though Ryan Lowe University of Ottawa Software Engineering class of lars Fri Jun AM Well looking just a few years back maybe Microsoft wasn t a company that took security seriously either As the demand for people with security training increases I m sure colleges will deliver Lars arun_coorg Arun World is Flat Friedman Sun Jun AM Hi College can teach some basic security aspects But it never teaches the real time stuffs I am doing Masters in Cybersec but when I go on with latest hacks and stuffs I find my study is nothing The latest technology threats are not at all included nor exposed in any university Microsoft might have not considered about security when they came into business or technology but they must provide information abt such things to the college which can be a part of study updating regularly Tranining is definately required when a grad student goes out of hos college Arun P H
