'MPEG Behind the Scenes D Lib Magazine September Volume Number ISSN MPEG Behind the Scenes Jane Hunter Distributed Systems Technology Centre University of Queensland jane dstc edu au Abstract The purpose of this article is to provide a better understanding of the objectives and components of the MPEG Multimedia Content Description Interface standard an overview of the current state of its development and an idea of its expected impact on digital libraries of the future Introduction It s clearly much more fun to develop multimedia content than to index it The amount of multimedia content available in digital archives on the World Wide Web in broadcast data streams and in personal and professional databases is growing out of control But this enthusiasm has led to increasing difficulties in accessing identifying and managing such resources due to their volume and complexity and a lack of adequate indexing standards The large number of recently funded DLI projects related to the resource discovery of different media types including music speech video and images indicates an acknowledgement of this problem and the importance of this field of research for digital libraries MPEG is being developed by the Moving Pictures Expert Group MPEG a working group of ISO IEC Unlike the preceding MPEG standards MPEG MPEG MPEG which have mainly addressed coded representation of audio visual content MPEG focuses on representing information about the content not the content itself The goal of the MPEG standard formally called the Multimedia Content Description Interface is to provide a rich set of standardized tools to describe multimedia content A single standard which can provide a simple flexible interoperable solution to the problems of indexing searching and retrieving multimedia resources will be extremely valuable and widely deployed Resources described using such a standard will acquire enhanced value Compliant hardware and software tools capable of efficiently generating and interpreting such standardized descriptions will be in great demand But will MPEG be able to deliver such a standard one which satisfies its formidable goals and widely heterogeneous scope whilst concurrently providing simplicity flexibility interoperability and usability Objectives MPEG aims to standardize a core set of Descriptors Ds that can be used to describe the various features of multimedia content pre defined structures of Descriptors and their relationships called Description Schemes DSs a language to define Description Schemes and Descriptors called the Description Definition Language DDL coded representations of descriptions to enable efficient storage and fast access MPEG descriptions a set of instantiated Description Schemes will need to be linked to the content itself to allow fast and efficient searching for material of a user s interest The descriptions may be physically located with the associated AV material in the same data stream on the same storage system or the descriptions could be stored remotely Hence mechanisms that can link the AV material to their MPEG descriptions and vice versa regardless of where the content and its descriptions are located are required Scope and Applications MPEG is intended to describe audiovisual information regardless of storage coding display transmission medium or technology It will address a wide variety of media types including still pictures graphics D models audio speech video and combinations of these e g multimedia presentations Ex les of MPEG data are an MPEG stream a video tape a CD containing music sound or speech a picture printed on paper or an interactive multimedia installation on the web MPEG will address both retrieval from digital archives pull applications as well as filtering of streamed audiovisual broadcasts on the Internet push applications It will operate in both real time and non real time environments A real time environment in this context means that the description is generated at the same time as the content is being captured e g smart cameras and scanners There are many applications and application domains which will potentially benefit from the MPEG standard Ex les of applications include Digital libraries image catalogue speech archive Broadcast media selection radio channel TV channel Multimedia editing personalised electronic news service media authoring The potential applications cover a wide range of domains which include Education Journalism e g searching speeches of a certain politician using his name his voice or his face Cultural services museums art galleries Film Video and Radio archives Entertainment e g video on demand searching a game karaoke Investigation services surveillance human characteristics recognition forensics Geographical information systems Remote sensing cartography ecology natural resources management Telemedicine and bio medical applications Work Plan Between October and October the scope objectives and requirements for MPEG were defined The end of this stage was marked by an open Call for Proposals CfP in October which asked for submissions of relevant technologies fitting the requirements In answer to the CfP some parties submitted in total almost proposals The proposals were evaluated at the MPEG Test and Evaluation Meeting in Lancaster in February according to their ability to satisfy the requirements Certain proposals and elements of proposals were selected to be incorporated into the current collaborative phase Participants involved in making and evaluating submissions and the ongoing development of MPEG include broadcasters electronics manufacturers content creators and managers publishers and intellectual property rights managers telecommunication service providers and academic researchers During the current collaborative phase selected elements of various proposals are incorporated into a common model the eXperimentation Model or XM The goal is to build the best possible model which is in essence a draft of the standard The XM is updated and improved in an iterative fashion until MPEG reaches the Committee Draft CD stage after several versions of the Working Draft Improvements to the XM are made through Core Experiments CEs CEs are defined to test the existing tools against new contributions and proposals within the framework of the XM according to well defined test conditions and criteria Finally those parts of the XM or of the Working Draft that correspond to the normative elements of MPEG will be standardized Table illustrates the work plan Call For Proposals October Evaluation February First Version of Working Draft December Committee Draft October Final Committee Draft February Draft International Standard July International Standard September Table Scheduled Work Plan Current State of the Descriptors A Descriptor D defines the syntax and the semantics of one representation of a particular feature of audiovisual content A feature is a distinctive characteristic of the data which is of significance to a user For ex le the color of an image is a feature Possible Descriptors corresponding to the color feature are color histogram RGB vector or a string A Descriptor value is an instantiation of a Descriptor for a given data set For ex le RGB colorstring red Table illustrates some of the current descriptors which have been incorporated into the XM or are undergoing core experiments CEs They have been subdivided into Visual and Audio descriptors Type Feature Descriptors Visual Basic Structures Grid layout Histogram Color Color space Dominant color Color histogram Color quantization Texture Spatial image intensity distribution Homogeneous texture Shape Object bounding box Region based shape Contour based shape D shape descriptor Motion Camera motion Object motion trajectory Parametric object motion Motion activity Motion trajectory features e g speed direction acceleration Audio Speech Annotation Lattice of words and phonemes plus metadata Timbre Ratio of even to odd harmonics Harmonic attack coherence Melody Melodic contour and rhythm Table Overview of Current Descriptors Each descriptor is defined by normative and non normative parts The normative parts consist of the descriptor s syntax semantics and binary representations of these The optional non normative parts are the recommended extraction and similarity matching methods Many low level features can be extracted from the content in fully automatic ways e g color histogram Recommended feature extraction algorithms are included in the non normative parts of some descriptors To allow for industry competition and to take advantage of expected improvements in technology they are not a mandatory part of the standard The same approach applies to similarity based querying of descriptor values in which results are ranked in order of degree of similarity with the query A recommended similarity matching method may be specified within a descriptor s non normative component but it is not required for interoperability Some of the open issues regarding descriptors include Is it possible to standardize certain descriptors e g Timbre without also standardizing the extraction and similarity matching methods How can one compare the performance of descriptors with overlapping functionality in the CEs How can one link procedural code e g the extraction and similarity matching methods to the description How can one define complex composite descriptors such as parameterized arrays in the DDL When does a composite descriptor become a description scheme Current State of the Description Schemes A Description Scheme DS specifies the structure and semantics of the relationships between its components which may be both Descriptors and Description Schemes The following concepts are used within the DS group to describe audiovisual content Syntactic structure the physical and logical structure of audiovisual content e g structures based on temporal segments and or spatial regions Semantic structure breakdown based on semantic meaning e g structures based on temporal events and or spatial objects Syntactic semantic links the associations between syntactic elements and semantic elements The Generic Audiovisual DS represents the integration of all of the DS proposals and submissions within a single DS At the top level it consists of A collection of Syntactic structure DSs i e physical features such as segments regions color texture and motion are described here A collection of Semantic structure DSs i e semantic features such as objects actors or events e g goal advertisement Madonna Syntactic semantic links DSs which relate the syntactic elements to the semantic elements Summary DS this is used to enable browsing at different levels of granularity MetaInfo DS this contains descriptors carrying author or publisher generated information e g ContentDS CreditsDS CreationPurposeDS RightsDS PublicationDS RightsDS MediaInfo DS this contains descriptors related to the storage media e g file format system medium colour sound length duration compression format Model DS this provides a way to describe the classification methods for audiovisual data or the correspondence between the current audiovisual content and other content through different models Figure below illustrates the structure and content of the Generic Audiovisual DS Figure The Generic Audiovisual Description Scheme One of the major problems with the DS work is the size and complexity of the Generic Audiovisual DS There is a certain amount of redundancy and overlapping functionality between the different DS proposals which have been included Some of the DS proposals which have been integrated are extremely complex and of dubious applicability Unless a library of basic simple DSs is provided many potential users who want simple bi level multimedia metadata structures will find the MPEG standard simply too bewildering or intimidating to use Current State of the Description Definition Language The Description Definition Language DDL is the language that allows the creation of new Description Schemes and Descriptors It also allows the extension and modification of existing Description Schemes The DDL has to be able to express spatial temporal structural and conceptual relationships between the elements of a DS and between DSs It must provide a rich model for links and references between one or more descriptions and the data that it describes It also has to be capable of validating descriptor data types both primitive integer text date time and composite histograms enumerated types In addition it must be platform and application independent and human and machine readable The general consensus within MPEG is that it should be based on XML syntax Of the ten DDL submissions which responded to the CfP in February one was based on the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language SMIL three were based on XML DTDs three were based on XML DTDs with extensions such as data typing and inheritance two were based on the Resource Description Framework RDF and one proposal was based on Open Knowledge Base Connectivity OKBC After evaluating the DDL proposals the recommendation was that although none of the proposals satisfied all of the requirements the proposal from DSTC provided the best starting point for further DDL development However it was also recommended that the DDL group should track the work of the W C in particular the XML Schema Working Group and the XLink XPath and XPointer Working Groups In May this year the XML Schema WG produced a part working draft of the XML Schema language XML Schema Part Structures and XML Schema Part Datatypes Discussions and preliminary encoding of the Generic Audiovisual DS led the DDL group to the decision to use XML Schema language as the basis for the DDL However certain reservations were raised at the Vancouver MPEG meeting in July concerning this approach The major concerns were MPEG s dependency on the output and time schedule of W C XML Schema WG Restricted access to internal documents associated with XML Schema development The effect of W C s copyright of XML Schema language on the ability to add MPEG specific extensions As a result of these concerns further discussions at the Vancouver meeting led to the decision to develop an MPEG specific language in parallel with the XML Schema development being carried out within W C A new grammar based on DSTC s proposal but using MPEG terminology Description Schemes and Descriptors and with modifications to ensure simple mapping to XML Schema was recently developed Based on this grammar the following tasks are currently being performed Specification of the BNF and an XML DTD for the new grammar Specification of the validation mechanisms which must be provided by a parser Development of a validating parser for this DDL Relationship To Other Standards MPEG is aware of and taking into account the activities of a number of other standards groups during the development process For the archival descriptions library e g MARC Z and archive e g EBU SMPTE ISAD G EAD Dublin Core CEN ISSS MMI standards are being taken into account Whilst for the streaming descriptions the broadcast Electronic Programme Guides EPGs e g DVB ATSC and web channels Channel Definition Format CDF standards are being considered For the intellectual property and rights management descriptions a liaison has been formed with the INDECS project The DDL group has been closely monitoring the work of the W C s XML Schema Working Group and the XLink XPath and XPointer Working Groups The MPEG community is attempting to combine efforts with these groups through liaisons This will hopefully maximize interoperability prevent duplication of work and take advantage of work already done through the use of shared common ontologies description schemes and languages MPEG hopes to act as a gateway or container for older established standards whilst at the same time providing a reference standard which can be used by proprietary multimedia applications or specific multimedia domains MPEG Related Projects There are undoubtedly a large number of MPEG related projects being undertaken within commercial enterprises particularly broadcasting and digital imaging companies which involve the adoption of MPEG conformance The details of most of these projects are confidential However details are available for a number of collaborative government funded research projects being undertaken three of which are described below The HARMONY Project HARMONY is a three way International Digital Libraries Initiative project between Cornell University the Distributed Systems Technology Centre and the University of Bristol s Institute for Learning and Research Technology Its objective is to develop a framework to deal with the challenge of describing networked collections of highly complex and mixed media digital objects The research will draw together work on the RDF XML Dublin Core MPEG and INDECS standards and will focus on the problem of allowing multiple communities of expertise e g library education rights management to define overlapping descriptive vocabularies for annotating multimedia content The DICEMAN Project DICEMAN is an EC funded project between Teltec Ireland DCU CSELT Italy IBM Germany INA France IST Portugal KPN Research Netherlands Riverland Britain and UPC Spain Its broad objective is to provide an end to end chain for indexing storage search and trading of digital AV content The technical work will focus on MPEG indexing through a COntent Provider s Application COPA the use of FIPA Agents to search and locate the best content and support for electronic commerce and rights management The A SM Project A Framework for Distributed Digital Video Production The A SM project which is based at GMD s IPSI Integrated Publication and Information Systems Institute is currently researching the application of IT support to all stages of the video production process The purpose is to seamlessly integrate an IT support framework into the production process i e pre production e g script development story boarding etc production e g collection of media data by using an MPEG camera etc and the post production support of non linear editing In collaboration with tv reporters cameramen and editors they have designed an MPEG camera in combination with a mobile annotation device for the reporter and a mobile editing suite suitable for the generation of news clips Future Expectations MPEG is at a crucial stage of its development In order to achieve wide spread adoption as the standard for describing multimedia resources MPEG will have to resolve a number of formidable issues including both high level philosophical issues and low level technical problems Some of the high level issues which need to be resolved include Reconciliation of the opposing approaches of the various communities involved in MPEG development which include the high level semantic approach of the database digital library community which typically believes that MPEG needs only to provide standardised structure and linking mechanisms to the international community the low level technical approach of the signal processing community which sees success in standardizing specific low level audiovisual features the free spirited creative approach of the artistic content creators who don t like to be constrained or pigeon holed by technocrats and their rigid rules tools and best practice guides Striking the right balance between semantic and structural interoperability media specific and community specific requirements and simplicity extensibility and flexibility Establishing and clarifying mutually beneficial relationships between MPEG and other existing standards bodies e g W C Dublin Core SMPTE Some of the low level technical issues and problems which need to be resolved include Integration of the Descriptor specifications within the Description Schemes Refinement and clarification of the Description Schemes Existing redundancies need to be removed before any new submissions are added A decision must be made on the DDL i e a choice between an MPEG specific language or XML Schema language Development of a validating parser for the chosen DDL Provision of libraries of Descriptors and Description Schemes Specification of temporal spatial spatio temporal conceptual links between descriptions and content Enabling of links to procedural code extraction and similarity matching algorithms Binary encoding of descriptions Encoding of descriptions within streaming multimedia Assuming that the MPEG participants do manage to overcome these obstacles the success of MPEG will then be dependent on the development and availability of hardware and software tools which can efficiently generate store search retrieve and interpret MPEG descriptions References Lesk Michael Perspectives on DLI Growing the Field D Lib

'Israeli Arms Sales to Iran Archives ABOUT WRMEA CONTACT US SUBSCRIBE DONATE ADVERTISE WITH US WRMEA AD CAMPAIGN MIDDLE EAST BOOK CLUB PALESTINIAN ARTS CRAFTS JOIN OUR MAILING LIST CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS LINKS KEEP TRACK OF AIPAC U S LOCAL NEWS Washington Report November Page Special Report Israeli Arms Sales to Iran By Jane Hunter In September when the Israeli government radio accused Iranian troops of training Lebanese Shiite guerrillas for attacks on the Israeli backed South Lebanon Army and said that Iranians themselves might also have been among those who attacked Israeli positions in Lebanon the US media reported those charges in great detail None found the time or space however to note how ironic it was for Israel to complain about Iranian military activities Iran might have been hard put to continue its costly six year old war with Iraq not to mention simultaneously stirring up followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini in Lebanon if Israel had not been willing to sell the Khomeini government great quantities of the weapons Iran desperately needed to keep its army in the field That is only one of the anomalies of Israel s booming arms trade US law and US policy also come in for some stretching and twisting Over the course of the Gulf war Iran s quest for weapons has become legendary with many countries and hordes of private arms dealers eager to conclude arms deals and reap the premium commissions Iran offers Israel with standing access to the same models of US made arms upon which the Shah based Iran s arsenal and with its desire to build up an indigenous arms industry has led the pack The London Observer estimated that Israel s arms sales to Iran total million annually Before when Shah Muhammad Reza Pahlavi held power Iran was the world s biggest buyer of Israeli arms The Islamic fundamentalist government which succeeded the Shah militantly damned Zionism up and down and hung a prominent Iranian Jew for spying for Israel In however when the Iraq Iran war began Iranian representatives met in Paris with Israel s deputy defense minister and worked out a Jews for arms deal Iran permitted Jews to emigrate and Israel sold Iran ammunition and spare parts for Chieftain tanks and US made F Phantom aircraft Channeled through a private Israeli arms dealer this particular agreement appropriately ended in when Iran was slow in paying its bills Although secrecy is the first principle in the netherworld of arms trading details of several subsequent major Israeli arms sales to Iran have come to light In Ya acov Nimrodi an intimate of leaders across the Israeli political spectrum sold the Iranian defense ministry worth of Hawk anti aircraft missiles mm mortars ammunition and other weapons through his Tel Aviv based company International Desalination Equipment Ltd From to Nimrodi had been Israel s military attache in Tehran On July Radio Luxembourg reported that Nimrodi had met in Zurich with the deputy defense minister and the top intelligence officer of Iran and with Rif at al Assad the brother of Syrian President Hafez al Assad Swiss government sources said that the meeting resulted in a deal to ship truckloads of weapons a day from Israel to Iran via Syria and Turkey On September a DC cargo plane returning from Iran and supposedly bound for Malaga Spain made an emergency landing in Tel Aviv Investigation revealed that the plane recently acquired from an obscure Miami firm by a shadowy Brussels based Nigerian company had been flying Hawk missiles from the US to Iran via Israel A Boeing registered to the company had been carrying loads of TOW missiles from Israel to Iran via Malaga At about the same time the London Observer reported that a ship carrying tons of Israeli material was making a rush delivery sailing directly to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas rather than first going to Zaire where the Iranian buyers would inspect the cargo In May West German authorities foiled an million ammunition deal and uncovered a tank deal in the process Charged in the case were an Israeli and a former Israeli citizen The West German weekly Stern said a telex from the state owned Israeli Military Industries dated April indicated official Israeli involvement In June of this year a Swedish businessman was reported to have acted as intermediary for Israeli sales of explosives to Iran The shipments went from Israel to Iran via Argentina In September United Press International reported that the Danish Sailor s Union had logs and records to prove that since May a Danish freighter had taken four ton shipments from the Israeli port of Eilat to Bandar Abbas in Iran The union was certain the arms were US made Re selling without permission arms acquired from the US and the sale of US weapons to Iran are both prohibited by US law In separate incidents involving sales negotiated within the US federal authorities have arrested two Israeli military reservists and a Yugoslav American Paul Cutter Cutter who has connections to Israeli Minister of Trade and Industry Ariel Sharon and who also told co workers he was authorized to sell arms Israel captured in Lebanon in has been convicted and jailed The Israeli government disassociated itself from these men Now however a federal sting operation has cracked the biggest arms deal yet US Customs Service agents drew retired Israeli army general Avraham Bar Am and co conspirators three of them Israelis into a carefully laid trap last April Tapes made by the Customs Service reveal Israeli government involvement in a billion conspiracy to sell US made arms to Iran through third countries On recordings made available to the Chicago Tribune Samuel Evans a London based American lawyer who coordinated two separate conspiracies to offer sophisticated aircraft missiles and ordnance to Iran is heard to say that he would be discussing the deal with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and that the authority for the transaction went right through to Prime Minister Peres The case is particularly serious because federal authorities presented evidence in their indictment that the deal included phony re export certificates attesting that Israel was re selling surplus arms to Turkey which is legal rather than to Iran which is not General Bar Am claimed from his jail cell that he had an Israeli government license to sell arms Denying any involvement Israeli officials insisted that the license was only to prospect for sales one of a thousand distributed to former military officers The Israelis have worked hard to bolster this contention In late September Defense Minister Rabin called a press conference to say the permit process would be changed to avoid the appearance of government approval But an earlier statement by Ya acov Nimrodi that such sales are government authorized and that permits come from a special department in the Israeli Defense Ministry and are difficult to get contradicts Rabin as have many reports over the years that it is common Israeli practice to sell arms through fronts and agents The US government has avoided dealing head on in public with the Israeli government over this issue When the Bermuda conspirators were arrested it was reported that the Israeli ambassador was called in for a stern warning It is unlikely however that prosecutors will focus on the Israeli government s role when the Bermuda conspirators stand trial in New York this November Over the last six years Washington has several times expressed its disapproval of arms sales to Iran During the hostage crisis Israel was specifically asked to stop deliveries while Iran was holding US hostages and it is possible that Israel complied At an October I luncheon he hosted Secretary of State George Shultz assured diplomats from the Arab states of the Gulf that Israel had told US officials it had stopped selling arms to Iran in Shultz in fact accused the Soviet Union of not cl ing down on sales by its allies to Iran During the Reagan administration US policy has swung through various levels of support for Iraq Israel s often stated policy on the Gulf war is to keep it going as long as possible because the dreadful carnage ties up the combatants and prevents either from attacking Israel In then Defense Minister Ariel Sharon blurted out duringa US speaking engagement that Israel sold arms to Iran because it regarded Iraq as the greater enemy and that the sales had been thoroughly discussed with US officials US officials acknowledged such discussions but denied that Israel had US permission Last spring what turned out to be an Israeli disinformation c aign propounded the notion that the US had asked Israel to sell arms to Iran The tapes in the Bar Am case are said to suggest that the US was considering shifting its support to Iran while the conspiracy sting was being hatched This kind of last ditch Israeli government defense probably supported by pro Israel political obscurantists in Washington has almost certainly been used before When it was revealed that Israel was shipping arms to the Soviet supported government of Ethiopia to fight Western assisted resistance movements and arms to the Argentine junta during the Malvinas Falklands war Israeli disinformationists in Washington sought to argue that Israeli actions which directly contravened

'Forest County Penna Poland Hunter Poland Hunter Jane Simpson Cemetery Markers for David and Andrew Hunter Old Methodist Cemetery Tionesta Forest PA The Hunter families of Northwestern Pennsylvania are of Scotch Irish ancestry a hardy race in which the Scotch stability shrewdness mental vigor and physical energy are blended with the geniality warmheartedness ambitions and versatile genius of the Irish These Hunters come from County Tyrone and County Down in Ireland Poland Hunter born in in Ireland arrived in Westmoreland Pa in the latter part of the eighteenth century His wife was Jane Simpson an English native who is reputed to have married Poland against her family s wishes It is said that this is the same Simpson family from which Ulysses S Grant is descended Poland and Jane were of true pioneer stock and with all the hopefulness of the Irish and the determination of the Scotch blood built a rude cabin cleared a field in the forest and thereby supplied the wants of their growing family Sixteen children were born to Poland and Jane twelve of which grew to maturity In Poland Hunter and his family moved to Tionesta and as a squatter appropriated the Island which bears his name located at the mouth of the Tionesta River Here he built his permanent home farmed the island and as a permanent settler obtained from the state a patent establishing ownership Poland and Jane lived on the island most of their lives although in later years Poland moved to the west side of the river At the base of the hill known as Hog Back near Hunter Run he built the first grist mill in Forest County When he died Poland Island was left to his son William for taking care of him during the last years of his life Ownership of the island remained in the Hunter family until when the heirs sold it and the land bordering it on the river shore for Later owners include R J Harmon Dan Mullet the Pioneer Material Company Jamieson Lumber and Supply Company Frank Ellis and F R Lanson Jack Sherman purchased it in February and established the Tionesta Sand Gravel Company In addition to farming Poland engaged in lumbering kindred pursuits in those days The History of Warren County related the following anecdote about Poland Hunter About the year while Henry Kinnear was acting in the capacity of constable in Venango County he had a warrant for the arrest of a notorious ruffian and desperado named Polen Hunter Against the threats of the criminal Kinnear attempted his forcible apprehension when he received from Hunter a wound in the hip from which he never recovered It is said that he succeeded in obtaining pecuniary redress for his injury The History of Forest County published in tell the following story Poland Hunter was a pretty rough specimen of Irish humanity He would sometimes take on more tanglefoot than he could walk straight under and staggering against a stump would say H l agin a stump and Poland agin that Poland Hunter shot a man by the name of Kinnear who had a warrant for his arrest Hunter peppered him with shot about the legs The wound was not mortal Hunter said that shooting him had made him a storekeeper and if he would let him shoot him again he would make a wholesale merchant out of him William Hunter was a chip of the old block Whenever he got too much crooked whiskey his temper got the best of him and everybody was in his way He and a man by the name of Groff always fought when they met Groff was small but full of grit In one of their fights Hunter bit Groff s finger The next day Groff was crossing the river to Hunter s grist mill He hallooed to Hunter when half way over the river I m bringing you another grist of finger nails to grind Though there are no historical records documenting the reason for the warrant on Poland Hunter it is likely the result of legal dispute with John Range Sr over the ownership of Hunter s Island Chief Cornplanter was called in to be a witness and to testify that he had passed through the back channel in a canoe thereby proving that Hunter s Island was indeed an island Hunter won the first case ever tried in Venango County Later on Poland s son William would marry Lt John Range s granddaughter Sarah Range Poland Hunter prospered and survived the hard life of a pioneer until dying at the age of eighty His wife Jane companion to all his privation and success had died two years earlier The party spirit ran high both then and now and Poland Hunter and his children were stalwart adherents of the Democratic party Burial was in the private Hunter cemetery on the west side at the

using the Latin form of the name Venator Aylmer le Hunter of the county of Ayr signed the Ragman Roll in as one of the nobles of Scotland submitting to Edward I of England By the fifteenth century the Hunters were hereditary keepers of the royal forests of Arran and the Little Cumbrae It appears that they held this office from an early date and the family claims a long descent from the holders of similar offices in England and Normandy before coming to Scotland By tradition an ancestor of the Hunters was with Rollo the Viking at the sack of Paris in and was later appointed one of the huntsmen to Rollo s descendants the Dukes of Normandy The Hunters followed William the Conqueror s queen Matilda to England and because of this their names are not included in the list of the companions of the Conqueror The Hunter s wife was lady in waiting to Queen Matilda and presumably had a hand in making the famous Bayeux Tapestry It seems likely that the family came to Scotland early in the twelfth century at the invitation of David I who was brought up with his sister at the Norman court in England and were given the In the sixteenth century the service to be rendered by the Hunters became

'A Comparison of Schemas for Dublin Core based Video Metadata Representation A Comparison of Schemas for Video Metadata Representation Jane Hunter CITEC Edward St Brisbane Qld Australia Phone Fax jane dstc edu au Liz Armstrong DSTC Level GP South Uni of Qld Qld Australia Phone Fax liz dstc edu au Abstract To enable the resource discovery of audiovisual documents over the WWW it will be necessary to define content description standards or metadata standards for complex multi layered time dependent information rich audiovisual data streams In particular this is the primary goal of the emerging MPEG standard the Multimedia Content Description Interface under development by the MPEG group In the past a lot of effort has gone into generating descriptors and description schemes for video indexing but comparatively little research has been done on schemas capable of defining the structure content and semantics of video documents and enabling validation and higher levels of automated content checking This paper compares the capabilities of the RDF Schema Extensible Markup Language XML Document Type Definitions DTD s Document Content Description DCD and Schema for Object Oriented XML SOX for supporting and validating hierarchical video descriptions based on Dublin Core MPEG and a specific hierarchical structure Finally this paper proposes a hybrid schema based on features from each of these schemas which will satisfy the MPEG Description Definition Language DDL requirements Keywords Video Metadata Schema Dublin Core MPEG Introduction To enable the resource discovery of audiovisual documents over the WWW it will be necessary to define content description standards or metadata standards for complex multi layered time dependent information rich data streams In particular this is the primary goal of the developing MPEG standard the Multimedia Content Description Interface under development by the MPEG group A number of papers have considered the application of Dublin Core DC and the Resource Description Framework RDF to video indexing An ex le of such an application is described briefly below However very little work has been done on defining schemas which are capable of actually validating and constraining video descriptions and their associated data models Such schemas will be necessary for the development of cost efficient user friendly semi automatic metadata generation and editing tools for video Such a schema would also provide a solution for the Description Definition Language DDL component of the MPEG requirements This paper first briefly presents a video description scheme based on Dublin Core and MPEG From this description format a list of schema requirements are generated It then compares the ability of a number of existing schemas and schema proposals including the RDF Schema XML DTDs DCD and SOX to satisfy descriptions of hierarchical video structures Ex les of schema definitions are given to illustrate their capabilities Finally this paper proposes a hybrid schema based on specific features from each of these schemas and schema proposals which would satisfy the MPEG Description Definition Language DDL requirements Proposed Video Description Scheme Dublin Core was designed specifically for generating metadata to facilitate the resource discovery of textual documents Although a number of workshops have been held to discuss the applicability of Dublin Core to non textual documents such as images sound and moving images they have primarily focused on extensions to the core elements through the use of subelements and schemes specific to audiovisual data to describe bibliographic type information rather than the actual content It has been shown that it is possible to describe both the structure and fine grained details of video content by using the fifteen Dublin Core elements plus qualifiers and encoding this within RDF This pure Dublin Core approach provides multiple levels of descriptive information At the top level the basic Dublin Core elements can be used to describe the bibliographic type information about the complete document e g Title Author Contributor Date etc This enables non specialist inter disciplinary searching independent of media type Extensions or qualifiers to specific DC elements Type Description Relation Coverage can be applied at the lower levels scenes shots frames to provide fine grained discipline and media specific searching e g Description Camera Angle The disadvantage of this approach is that the semantic refinement of Dublin Core through the use of qualifiers eventually leads to a loss of semantic interoperability The alternative is a hybrid approach in which RDF or some other framework is used to combine both simple unqualified Dublin Core and MPEG descriptors within a single description container Dublin Core can be used for generic media independent search and retrieval while MPEG can be used for object specific fine grained queries Our future research will compare and evaluate these two approaches for multimedia resource discovery and determine the best balance between semantic interoperability extensibility and modularity At this stage we don t know the specific attributes of each level we can only assume that each structural component will possess both a set of Dublin Core attributes plus a set of MPEG attributes as illustrated in Figure below For ex le if DC Type Image Moving TV News Scene then valid descriptors will include both the DC simple elements plus MPEG descriptors such as script transcript editlist keyframe etc If DC Type Image Moving TV News Scene Shot then valid descriptors will include both the DC elements plus keyframe camera_distance camera_angle camera_motion opening_transition closing_transition If DC Type Image Moving TV News Scene Shot Frame then a valid descriptors will be the DC elements plus colour_histogram Figure shows the logical structure the structural components and their associated Dublin Core attributes and some assumed MPEG attributes for the proposed video description scheme Figure Multilayered Hierarchical Structure and Attributes of Video Video Metadata Schema Requirements In order to represent the video structure and Dublin Core descriptors outlined in Figure a suitable schema must be able to support the following Hierarchical structure definitions The schema must be able to constrain the structure to a precise hierarchy in which complete video documents sit at the top level These in turn contain sequences which contain scenes which contain shots which contain frames which contain objects or actors Figure illustrates this hierarchy Each level or class within the hierarchy must be constrained to possess only specific attributes In our description scheme we assume that each layer possesses the simple optional and extensible DC elements plus a set of class specific attributes unique to that layer These represent the set of MPEG descriptors for that class when they become available Element and attribute inheritance It should be possible to specify sub classing with inheritance of attributes and elements from the upper to lower classes In addition sub classes should be able to have their own additional attributes and elements This allows efficient reuse and customization of document schemas Data Typing It must be possible to constrain the values of attributes to certain data types Data types supported should include primitive data types as well as Schemes e g SMPTE enumerated data types controlled vocabularies file types images URIs and complex data types e g colour histograms D vectors graphs RGB values etc It should also be possible to specify multiple alternative schemes or data types for a particular attribute Cardinality within attributes should be representable It must be possible to specify that an attribute can have zero one or multiple values Ideally the minimum and maximum number of attributes should also be specifiable e g a scene must contain between and shots Spatio temporal specifications The Schema must be able to support the specification of temporal characteristics e g begin and end time of segments and their duration Similarly it should be able to support spatial representation e g regions within an image or motion along a line Spatial temporal and conceptual relations Spatial relations such as neighbouring objects and temporal relations such as sequential or parallel segments should be supported Given such a relationship between two classes it should also be possible to constrain specific attribute values of these classes For ex le the start and end times of scenes contained within a sequence must lie within the start and end time of that sequence Human readability It is desirable rather than mandatory that both the schema and the description output from the schema should be human readable Availability of supporting technologies such as parsers capable of validating input descriptions databases and query languages These requirements are similar and compatible with the DDL requirements listed in section of the MPEG Requirements Document Resource Description Framework RDF Schema The Resource Description Framework RDF enables interoperability between applications which exchange machine understandable information on the Web A model for representing metadata as well as a syntax for encoding RDF based on XML has been defined in the RDF Model and Syntax Specification document RDF is based on a resource and property data model system A collection of classes typically authored for a specific purpose or domain and the definition of their properties attributes and corresponding semantics represent an RDF schema A schema defines not only the properties of the resource or class Title Author Subject Size Color etc but also may define the kinds of resources being described books webpages people companies etc The details of RDF schemas have been defined in the RDF Schema Specification document Classes are organized in a hierarchy and offer extensibility through subclass refinement This way in order to create a schema slightly different from an existing one one can just provide incremental modifications to the base schema Through the sharability of schemas RDF will support the reusability of metadata definitions Due to RDF s incremental extensibility agents processing metadata will be able to trace the origins of schemes they are unfamiliar with back to known schemes and perform meaningful actions on metadata they weren t originally designed to process The sharability and extensibility of RDF also allows metadata authors to use multiple inheritance to mix definitions to provide multiple views to their data taking advantage of work done by others The XML namespace mechanism serves to identify different RDF Schemas RDF schemas can be compared to XML Document Type Descriptions DTDs Unlike an XML DTD which gives specific constraints on the syntactical structure of a document an RDF schema provides semantical information about the interpretation of the statements given in an RDF data model Given its goals RDF appears to be the ideal approach for supporting descriptors from multiple description schemes simultaneously as required by the MPEG DDL Ex le of a Suitable RDF Schema This section describes an RDF schema definition that attempts to map to the diagram in Figure and support the requirements listed above Since we want the DC simple attributes to be applicable to every component or layer videos sequences scenes shots frames and objects are all sub classes of a top level document class which possesses the DC attributes In addition each sub class has its own additional descriptive properties or attributes which will correspond to MPEG descriptors when they become available lt rdf RDF xmlns rdf http www w org TR WD rdf syntax xmlns rdfs http

such as contains by which the hierarchical structure can be defined i e videos contain sequences which contain shots which contain frames which contain objects and actors If you create a property contains for video then how do you also apply it to sequence scene and shot Since each property requires a single range then generic relationships such as contains cannot be used Instead a separate property must be defined for each domain range pair This is tedious and repetitive The lack of class specific constraints on domain and range of properties is a major limitation of RDF particularly when applied to complex multilayered documents in which you want to specify constraints on structural spatial temporal and conceptual relationships between components lt rdf PropertyType ID

Video Metadata RDF Schemas within the context of this application have the following advantages RDF Schema is able to provide meanings to elements or semantic structure not possible using purely syntactic schemas such as XML DTDs However the sorts of machine understandable meanings provided in the current version of RDF Schema is very limited so the advantage of semantic validation is virtually negligible The other schemas really only provide implicit child or contains relationships between elements With RDF you can specify any relationship types explicitly through properties but this is limited by the need to specify a single range It isn t possible to constrain a particular relationship to multiple range domain pairs e g sequences can only contains scenes which can only contain shots etc Multiple namespaces This enables the same feature to have different descriptors which correspond to different domains or description schemes The ability to mix classification vocabularies within one XML based encoding allows video authors or others to deliver richer domain specific content descriptions thus increasing the re usability of the video on the Web This is a key requirement of the MPEG DDL Inheritance is supported through sub classes and sub properties This provides easy extensibility and reuse of code A simple RDF parser SiRPAC exists but it has limited validation capabilities checking only that the domain and range constraints are satisfied It is human readable simple to understand and thus simple to extend or customize Limitations of the RDF Schema for Video Metadata RDF Schema has the following problems or limitations Unstable The RDF Schema specifications are still under development and change frequently Limited or no data typing Almost all data typing will need to be provided by external namespaces which don t yet exist No cardinality It isn t possible to specify optional zero or multiple values for an attribute Range constraints such as minimum and maximum values are not supported Class specific range constraints are not possible Only one range is possible for a given property The only way to do provide multiple ranges is to create multiple properties e g secs_start_time frame_start_time SMPTE_start_time RDF Schema can t describe multilayered structures using a single generic contains property This requires multiple specific contains properties i e contains_sequences contains_scenes contains_shots contains_frames The alternative is to implement code outside of the schema which understands DC Relation HasParts semantics and can perform the validation Property centricity makes readability difficult The link between properties and classes is defined within the property definitions not the class definitions No query language exists for RDF Given a video structure to find videos with similar structures you need to be able to store RDF structures in a directed graph with associated attribute values in a database The simplest way to specify spatial and temporal relationships is via the Collection elements Seq Bag and Alt but these provide limited semantics Since no lt Par gt element exists within RDF the lt Bag gt element must be used to specify parallelism For spatial relationships such as neighbours if the list of neighbours is in a collection can we assume that the first one is the nearest neighbour Cannot map relationship type properties between classes to constraints on the attribute values of the classes involved For ex le if two scenes abutt then their respective end and start frame numbers must be consecutive If a sequence contains a scene then the start and end times of the scene must lie within the start and end times of the sequence This is not supported by RDF Schema RDF Schema is an incomplete mapping of the RDF Syntax and Data model There are very useful features available within the RDF Syntax and Data Model Spec which aren t supported in the RDF Schema XML DTDs Extensible Markup Language XML Document Type Definitions DTDs provide a subset of SGML for describing documents XML was developed by the XML Working Group under the World Wide Web Consortium W C in The complete XML spec is available from the W C Each XML document has both a logical and a physical structure Physically the document is composed of units called entities An entity may refer to other entities to cause their inclusion in the document A document begins in a root or document entity Logically the document is composed of declarations elements comments character references and processing instructions all of which are indicated in the document by explicit markup The logical and physical structures must nest properly The function of the markup in an XML document is to describe its storage and logical structure and to associate attribute value pairs with its logical structures XML provides the document type declaration to define constraints on the logical structure and to support the use of predefined storage units An XML document is valid if it has an associated document type declaration and if the document complies with the constraints expressed in it Document type declarations are made in a Document Type Definition DTD file The DTD file then contains a formal definition of a particular type of document outlining the element names and the structure of the document An Ex le of an XML DTD for Video Documents The structure is defined in the element definitions at the top of the DTD Each element has a set of associated attributes All elements have an ID attribute plus the DC attributes In addition sequences scenes and shots also have a set of time attributes begin end duration Each element also has its own set of level specific attributes which will correspond to the MPEG descriptors when they become available lt xml version gt lt DOCTYPE videodoc lt hierarchical structure of videodoc gt lt ELEMENT videodoc sequence gt lt ELEMENT sequence scene

to understand one namespace XML is simpler than SGML HyTime etc XML DTDs are easy to read and understand Short and sweet without all that data typing Hierarchical structures are supported but only on a syntactical basis Disadvantages of XML DTDs for Video Metadata No name spaces Since name spaces are not supported definitions such as Dublin Core attributes will need to be redefined unless external entities are used External entities provide a similar capability to namespaces An external entity can be retrieved from an external DTD via a URI to this DTD and the entity s ID Cardinality of attributes is zero or one in XML DTDs This creates problems with DC attributes which are optional and repeatable They may need to be declared as elements There is very limited support for data typing Only three kinds of attribute types are supported a string type a set of tokenized types and enumerated types However Bray has shown that it is possible to attach strong type declarations to XML elements using reserved attributes It is a purely syntactic machine understandable schema which can t provide any of the semantics associated with complex structured multimedia data or support object oriented data modelling concepts There is no inheritance There are no relationships possible other than the implicit contains Document Content Description DCD for XML The Document Content Description DCD facility for XML is an RDF vocabulary designed for describing constraints to be applied to the structure and content of XML documents It consists of a set of properties used to constrain the types of elements and names of attributes that may appear in an XML document the contents of the elements and the values of the attributes It was designed to provide semantics over and above the purely syntactical XML DTDs It was also designed to be conformant with the RDF Model and Syntax Specification with some simplifications DCD also incorporates a subset of an earlier submission to W C the XML Data Submission The introduction to the XML Data Submission says that it describes an XML vocabulary for schemas that is for defining and documenting object classes It can be used for classes which are strictly syntactic for ex le XML or those which indicate concepts and relations among concepts as used in relational databases KR graphs and RDF The former are called syntactic schemas the latter conceptual schemas Thus XML Data and DCD add object oriented and data modelling concepts such as class inheritance to purely syntactic schemas such as XML DTDs DCD Schemas are based on elements and attributes Elements correspond to RDF property types DCD declarations constrain the content and attributes of elements in document instances by assigning properties to objects of type ElementDef and AttributeDef Ex le of a DCD Schema The DCD Schema below is based on the following assumptions The Dublin Core elements are all described in a separate name space The root element video_doc contains video_sequences which contains video_scenes etc The Dublin Core elements apply to every level In addition the sequence scene and shot elements possess start_time end_time and duration elements In addition each level has its own unique elements attributes corresponding to MPEG descriptors lt DCD xmlns DC http purl org metadata dublin_core xmlns CDT http www w org TR complex_datatypes gt lt DCD

Provides better data typing than RDF Schemas and XML DTDs but still only basic Also provides upper and lower bound constraints on attribute values Provides cardinality Supports multiple namespaces As an RDF vocabulary it inherits the advantages of the data modelling concepts in RDF plus constructs such as RDF Seq and RDF Alt Disadvantages of DCD for Video Metadata Currently no subclassing or inheritance but this is planned for the future The proposal is to create subclasses from existing elements through an extends property Only basic data typing is supported not complex data types There is no support for multiple alternate data types except if you create alternate elements with different data types e g start_time value can be SMPTE secs frames int Also there is no support for constraining the values of certain attributes of related elements Doesn t support data types such as points lines polygons colour histograms etc These would all have to be described in a separate namespace e g http www w org TR complex_datatypes It is not possible to specify that just the element s datatype is to be a value from another namespace You need to specify that the element itself is totally described in another namespace Only Seq and or Alt Groups are available Bag is not a legal value for the RDF Order property Seq is fine for specifying sequential components but for multimedia there is also a need to support groups of elements which run in parallel The RDF Bag element is the most suitable for specifying this in the absence of any Par value but it isn t supported in DCD Schema for Object Oriented XML SOX Schema for Object Oriented XML SOX provides a facility for defining the structure content and semantics of XML documents to enable XML validation and automated content checking SOX provides an alternative to XML DTDs for modeling markup relationships The introduction to the SOX specification says that it provides the following advantages over XML DTDs More efficient software development processes for distributed applications Basic intrinsic datatypes An extensible datatyping mechanism Content model and attribute interface inheritance A powerful namespace mechanism Embedded documentation SOX supports three varieties of datatypes scalar datatypes enumerated datatypes and format datatypes Scalar datatypes are derived from the basic number datatype and support specification of the number of digits and decimal places minimum and maximum value range and a mask An enumerated datatype may be derived from any of the intrinsic datatypes and may specify an enumeration of valid values A format datatype may be derived from any of the intrinsic datatypes and must specify a mask In SOX element types may inherit their content models and attribute definitions directly from another named element type An element type may also inherit and extend an attribute list Specialization of attribute definitions allows refinement and restriction of attribute datatype enumeration list and default value Additionally an attribute value may be defined to be inherited from the identically named attribute on a parent or older ancestor element Thus for ex le namespaces can be inherited from superordinate elements The SOX namespace facility enables Objects from any identifiable namespace to be used in building a SOX document That is any element attribute datatype enumeration entity interface notation parameter or processing instruction may be imported from any namespace A SOX document is a valid XML document according to the SOX DTD The schema designer is free to employ the same XML tools used for traditional XML documents This means that a SOX document can processed by a validating XML parser formatted according to an XSL stylesheet and managed by any DOM compliant or SAX compliant application SOX Ex le In this ex le the structural elements video_doc video_sequence video_scene video_shot video_frame and video_object are declared first They each possess the DC attributes plus their own specific elements and attributes lt schema name video_doc namespace http www dstc edu au schemas video_doc xml gt lt h gt Video Metadata

Metadata XML query languages when available will work on SOX documents XML parsers will work on SOX documents In order to perform complete validation of SOX specific constraints extra parsing code will be required Provides much better data typing capabilities than the other schemas scalar enumerated and formatted data types SOX provides the best cardinality with occurs n m Inheritance provides the possibility for reuse of code elements and datatype definitions Elements can inherit their definitions from existing elements using instanceof and also extend with new attributes using extends Disadvantages of SOX for Video Metadata SOX was designed for validating business documents in e commerce applications Consequently it is more suitable for validating static forms than complex multimedia structures It is element focussed rather than entity focussed It only provides the implicit contains relationship Structural constraints would require multiple contains elements Inheritance is possible but users can only extend elements with new attributes Ideally one should be able to extend elements with both new attributes and new elements Not an RDF vocabulary Conclusions the Ultimate Schema None of the above schemas is ideal for describing complex multimedia documents They all satisfy some of the requirements but fall down in other areas None of them is designed for describing complex hierachical structures in which there are spatial temporal structural and conceptual relationships between the components and where these relationships map to constraints on the relative attribute values of the related components For ex le spatial relationships such as neighbours in front of behind overlapping and surrounds correspond to certain constraints on the values of the shape location or volume attributes of the related objects Similarly temporal relationships such as contains sequential parallel and overlapping should be mapped to constraints on the start time end time and duration of the components None of the schemas support these capabilities RDF Schema claims to differ from the other schemas in that it is not a syntactic schema but a semantic schema However the sorts of machine understandable meanings provided in the current version of RDF Schema is very limited So the advantage of semantic validation is negligible RDF Schema is good at containing and combining descriptors from different name spaces communities but it has virtually no data typing Data types must be defined in a separate name space This has yet to be done but the work is intended to be done within the W C XML Schema Working Group which has recently been set up RDF Schemas also don t easily support multi layered hierarchical structures because of the inability to specify generic relationship types using properties and to apply these across multiple domain range pairs So although RDF is better than the other schemas because of its ability to specify relationships other than the implicit child or contains relationship which is the only one that the other schemas offer this facility is limited to a specific range and domain due to the lack of class specific constraints XML DTDs offer simplicity and fast cost effective development due to the ready availability of parsers tools and applications However as a data modelling language they have limited semantics which XML Data DCD and SOX schemas try to expand by adding things such as strong data typing and lexical constraints DCD is an improvement on XML DTDs because it provides better data typing and also provides additional semantics via its RDF conformity However it doesn t currently support inheritance although this is a future goal SOX has the best data typing It is also XML compliant so that XML parsers and XML QL when it becomes available will work on it It supports inheritance but with attribute extension only not element extension It is not RDF conformant SOX also provides the best cardinality enabling the minimum other than or and maximum number of children of an element to be specified e g maximum of shots per scene DCD and XML DTDs can only specify zero or more or one or more children RDF Schema doesn t support cardinality An additional desirable schema feature would be the ability to define equivalence relationships between attributes and define constraints based on these relationships For ex le suppose there are two attributes ColourText and ColourHistogram Then in an ideal schema users would be able to define an enumerated data type for ColourText red yellow green blue etc and for each of these possible values a correponding permissable range of ColourHistograms would be defined An even more complex ex le is the mapping of a textual description attribute to some combination of shape colour and texture attribute value ranges Such a schema could then be used to both validate the integrity of the input data but also automatically generate metadata where it is not provided This ability to map from high level features such as text to low level features colour shape texture is one of the requirements of the MPEG DDL It would also greatly improve the searchability of complex multimedia archives None of the schemas examined provide such sophisticated capabilities Other relevant schemas not covered in this paper include the XSchema specification and XML Data XSchema is very similar to SOX Formerly known as XSD XSchema began as a proposal for the representation of XML DTDs as XML documents The advantages of using XML document syntax to describe XML document structures include the ability to browse and edit XSchemas using XML aware tools This can t be done on DTDs which are not pure XML documents Although XML Data has some very useful features it appears to have been superseded by DCD The Ideal Schema for Multimedia Based on the above analysis and comparisons the best solution for video metadata representation is one which provides the object oriented semantical concepts of RDF but expresses them within an easily understood human readable XML schema We have proposed such a XML schema for the MPEG DDL which provides the following features The semantics and object oriented concepts of inheritance provided by RDF through classes sub classes properties and sub properties The extensible data typing capabilities of SOX The addition of a relation entity which allows spatial temporal structural and conceptual relations to be defined between classes and constraints on the domain range and property values to be specified The XML namespace facility Cardinality Temporal and spatial controls and specifications Linking mechanisms which enable links between descriptions and between content and descriptions The two major problems associated with this proposal are that it constitutes yet another schema or language and there are likely to be quite complex extensions necessary to the basic XML parser in order to perform complete validation of all of the constraints The W C XML Schema Working Group is looking at a XML based schema language which provides support for data typing and structural constraints currently lacking in XML DTDs Their charter includes delivering a recommendation on the best combination of DCD XML Data SOX and RDF for validating document syntax Based on the XML Schema Requirements document there is a very real possibility that the schema which they develop will satisfy the majority of the MPEG DDL requirements Acknowledgements The authors wish to

'About Hunters Hunters Marlborough New Zealand The Jane Hunter story Hunter s Wines has a reputation for consistently producing the highest quality wines year after year and Jane is the driving force behind its ongoing success Not surprisingly Jane has been described by the London Sunday Times as the star of New Zealand wine In she received an OBE for service to the wine industry and in was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Massey University for her outstanding contribution to the industry A fiercely independent family owned winery Hunter s Wines was the combined dream of Ernie and Jane Hunter It was the inspired foresight of the ever enthusiastic Ernie New Zealand rsquo s lsquo unofficial wine ambassador rsquo which recognised the vast potential of Marlborough as a premier wine growing region However only five years after producing his first six award winning wines in fact the first six Hunter rsquo s Wines to emerge he was tragically killed in a motor accident at the age of In the aftershock of this Jane herself a highly qualified viticulturist with a long family history of Australian grape growing resolved to build on the vineyard s proven potential Through her strong determination together with the talents of Chief Winemaker Gary Duke and eminent Australian oenologist Dr Tony Jordan Hunter s Wines has achieved an enviable reputation both in this country and in the wine capitals of the world This list of industry accolades is impressive indeed Quality not quantity was Ernie Hunter s catch cry and this philosophy lives on to this day Since Jane has been owner viticulturist and managing director of Hunter s Wines During that time the vineyard has expanded to times its original size Approximately of this production is exported particularly to the UK but also to Switzerland Ireland Denmark Australia the USA Canada Singapore Hong Kong Denmark and Brazil Janes s wine beginnings Jane was brought up in South Australian wine country and her father still grows grapes in the Riverland just north of the famous Barossa Valley After a short period studying animal husbandry Jane changed her specialist area and is now a highly qualified viticulturist with an Agricultural Science degree from the University of Adelaide Jane was initially employed by Montana as national viticulturist in charge of all Montana vineyards organising research and development and liaising with managers and contract growers In the late Ernie Hunter and Jane began a fledgling winery near Blenheim using borrowed gear from an old cider factory in Christchurch Four years later after Ernie s sudden death Jane took over the management of Hunter s Wines The winery has continued to grow in size annual output and reputation To date Hunter s Wines has won more than gold medals at wine competitions including London Sydney Hong Kong Switzerland Australia and New Zealand Hunter s Marlborough Garden Hunter s winery features a Marlborough Garden

Sidney and that William Carr Hunter is another brother as they have different families _____________________________________________________________________ Additions to the generations are The latest

'MW Papers Combining the CIDOC CRM and MPEG to Describe Multimedia in Museums Archives Museum Informatics Murray Ave Suite D Pittsburgh PA USA info archimuse com www archimuse com Search A MI Join our Mailing List Privacy Combining the CIDOC CRM and MPEG to Describe Multimedia in Museums Jane Hunter DSTC Pty Ltd University of Queensland Australia Abstract This paper describes a proposal for an interoperable metadata model based on international standards which has been designed to enable the description exchange and sharing of multimedia resources both within and between cultural institutions Domain specific ontologies have been developed by two different ISO Working Groups to standardize the semantics associated with the description of museum objects CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model and the description of multimedia content MPEG but no single ontology or metadata model exists for describing museum multimedia content This paper describes an approach which combines the domain specific aspects of MPEG and CIDOC CRM models into a single ontology for describing and managing multimedia in museums The result is an extensible model which could lead to a common search interface and the open exchange sharing and integration of heterogeneous multimedia resources distributed across cultural institutions Keywords Multimedia Metadata Interoperability MPEG CIDOC CRM Introduction Multimedia provides museums with a rich paradigm for capturing communicating and preserving cultural information It offers new capabilities for structuring interpreting and communicating knowledge and the significance of artifacts within museum collections through the use of digital video audio images graphics and animation Making collections available in digital form both in house and through networks provides museums with a tremendous opportunity to meet their educational mandate When linked together over networks museum multimedia databases become even more valuable as cross cultural resources for educational and research purposes In addition the potential to re use multimedia content to create new intellectual property has further accelerated the growth in the size and number of institutional multimedia databases Existing multimedia objects are being combined and reused to generate complex interactive multimedia hypermedia virtual reality displays and participatory exhibitions This has led to a demand for systems and tools which can satisfy the more sophisticated requirements for storing managing searching accessing retrieving sharing and tracking complex multimedia resources Metadata is the value added information which documents the administrative descriptive preservation technical and usage history and characteristics associated with resources It provides the underlying foundation upon which digital asset management systems rely to provide fast precise access to relevant resources across networks and between organisations The metadata associated with multimedia objects is infinitely more complex than simple metadata for resource discovery of simple atomic textual documents and the problems and costs asssociated with generating such metadata are correspondingly magnified Metadata standards enable interoperability between systems and organizations so that information can be exchanged and shared Standardized metadata models have been developed to describe museum objects CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model CIDOC Conceptual and to describe multimedia content MPEG ICS but no standards currently exist for specifically describing museum multimedia content Hence the key goal of this project is to analyze and evaluate each of these existing standards and to determine a way to merge the two ontologies to generate a standardized model for describing museum multimedia content Such a model which is capable of supporting the exchange of information between existing collection management systems for physical artefacts and emerging digital asset management systems would enable knowledge and resources to be shared re used and exchanged to a much greater extent than is currently possible both within and between museums Hence in the remainder of this paper we describe both the CIDOC CRM and MPEG metadata models We then analyze them both to determine the overlaps intersections and differences Based on this analysis we hope to be able to determine how the models can best be merged to combine the two domain specific vocabularies of MPEG and CIDOC CRM without introducing semantic inconsistencies or redundancies The final outcome is in essence a single machine understandable extensible ontology designed to support the description and management of multimedia resources within museums The Nature of Multimedia in Museums Types of Multimedia in Museums Audiovisual or multimedia content within museums is highly diverse and varies widely in origin genre purpose media type format quality age context and the reason for its cultural significance or retention within a museum or collection Multimedia in museums can include everything from disintegrating maps on paper to full feature films on DVD Within the scope of this paper we are referring to images audio video multimedia graphics and animation in both analog and digital form Table below provides an overview of the typical constitution of multimedia collections within a museum Table Overview of Museum Multimedia Types In most cases it is the semantic content which is depicted or recorded on the multimedia resource which is of value i e the resource records an event place person object or concept which is of cultural historical geographic or educational importance For some multimedia resources the cultural or historical significance lies with the medium or recording technology e g the earliest photographs film video and audio recordings In some cases the multimedia object is valuable because of the person who captured or recorded it e g home movie collection of John F Kennedy or because it is part of a larger collection or bequest or it is exemplary of a particular genre era or technique In many cases both the semantic content and the context agents technique and medium are all of importance and need to be Often multimedia content has been generated for preservation and dissemination purposes The multimedia resource may be a digital surrogate of the original culturally significant museum artifact which is too valuable or fragile to be handled or is inaccessible for reasons of location In many situations the multimedia resources are created as an alternative visual representation image model of a physical museum artifact or as a replacement for earlier analog and digital formats which are becoming obsolescent Hence in addition to the typical bibliographic information the metadata for multimedia resources may need to describe detailed formatting information structural or segmentation information temporal spatial and spatio temporal segments semantic information description of the objects people places events which are recorded and the event history and rights information A detailed description of the metadata requirements for multimedia in museums is provided in the next section The Metadata Requirements for Multimedia in Museums The metadata associated with multimedia resources can be classified into a number of different categories Bibliographic metadata this includes information about the resource s creation production date place and the individuals or organizations involved e g producer director and cast and the resource s classification information e g title abstract subject and genre Formatting metadata this includes information about the format encoding storage and system requirements associated with the resource Table below shows the formatting metadata typically recorded for different media types Table Typical Format Metadata for Different Media Types Structural metadata this provides information about the structural decomposition of the multimedia resource into spatial temporal or spatio temporal segments scenes shots frames image regions and the relationships between these segments Content metadata this provides indexes to the actual content which is recorded or depicted within the multimedia resource Content metadata can vary from natural language descriptions of the people objects places or events which are depicted to the low level audio or visual features such as colour histograms or volume Events and rights metadata this is information describing the life history of the resource It includes everything from acquisition and relocation events to the reformatting editing repackaging and distribution events to the metadata attribution events to the usage copyright agreements and permission events A number of projects have developed or are developing metadata models for multimedia in museums Gabriel The TOKEN or for historical audiovisual collections The ECHO These projects are either developing their own application specific data models and vocabularies or choosing one of the existing standards MPEG or CIDOC CRM None have considered the approach of merging ontologies from the museum domain and the multimedia domain into a single ontology A Typical Ex le Consider the following ex le which is typical of multimedia content held by museums or archives a film owned by the Museum of Victoria which contains unedited footage of Australian Aboriginal tribal ceremonies filmed by anthropologist Baldwin Spencer between and Below is the catalogue

below we compare the abilities of the CIDOC CRM and MPEG to describe museum multimedia by describing this ex le using their domain specific vocabularies The CIDOC CRM Overview of the CIDOC CRM The CIDOC object oriented Conceptual Reference Model CRM was developed by the ICOM CIDOC Documentation Standards Group to provide an ontology for cultural heritage information Its primary role is to serve as a basis for mediation of cultural heritage information and thereby provide the semantic glue needed to enable wide area information exchange and the integration of heterogenous resources between cultural institutions The CIDOC CRM is presented as an object oriented extensible data model expressed in RDF Schema RDF Schema Spec Figure illustrates the class hierarchy for the CIDOC CRM as generated by the SIS knowledge base ICS The detailed specification of the CIDOC CRM Version which includes detailed descriptions of the class and property definitions hierarchies and relationships is available from Crofts Figure The CIDOC CRM Class Hierarchy In order to understand and evaluate the CIDOC CRM s ability to describe multimedia resources we apply it to the ex le in Section A CIDOC CRM Description of the Ex le Ex le Together with an analysis of the class and property hierarchies provided by the CIDOC CRM this exercise reveals that the CIDOC CRM s strengths lie in its ability to describe Identification information Acquisition and ownership information Physical movement location and relocation information Physical attributes and features dimensions marks visual items material sections physical location etc Historical events CIDOC CRM supports rich semantic descriptions of concepts or events both real world events as well as the events which occur in the life cycle of a resource and those events which are depicted in the visual information objects However the CIDOC CRM is limited in its ability to describe digital objects and particularly digital multimedia or audiovisual content The following requirements are inadequately supported Formatting attributes encoding storage system requirements for digital images audio video text and multimedia such as those shown in Table are not currently supported It is possible to define sections of physical objects using spatial measurements or coordinates and the temporal location of Events or Periods using the Date and TimeSpan entities but not temporal spatial or spatio temporal locations within non physical digital media Physical features can be described but not visual or audio features such as colour histograms regions shape texture volume etc Hierarchical or sequential summaries of audiovisual content which specify keyframes scene changes or key videoclips are not supported The CIDOC CRM provides the is_documented_in property to record the relationship of a culturally significant physical or real world artefact or event to its visual audio audiovisual recording which is classed as a Document However there is no explicit support for the different media types in CIDOC CRM Because the CIDOC CRM is designed to provide an extensible underlying framework it may be possible to improve support for multimedia descriptions through the addition of MPEG multimedia specific sub classes and sub properties to existing CIDOC CRM superclasses and super properties We investigate this approach in Section MPEG the Multimedia Content Description Interface An Overview of MPEG The Moving Pictures Expert Group MPEG a working group of ISO IEC is expected to shortly release the final standard for MPEG MPEG Overview the Multimedia Content Description Interface a standard for describing multimedia content The goal of this standard is to provide a rich set of standardized tools to enable both humans and machines to generate and understand audiovisual descriptions which can be used to enable fast efficient retrieval from digital archives pull applications as well as filtering of streamed audiovisual broadcasts on the Internet push applications MPEG can describe audiovisual information regardless of storage coding display transmission medium or technology It addresses a wide variety of media types including still pictures graphics D models audio speech video and combinations of these e g multimedia presentations MPEG provides a core set of Descriptors Ds that can be used to describe the various features of multimedia content pre defined structures of Descriptors and their relationships called Description Schemes DSs Initially MPEG definitions description schemes and descriptors were expressed solely in XML Schema XML Schema proved ideal for expressing the syntax structural cardinality and datatyping constraints required by MPEG However semantic interoperability is necessary to enable systems to exchange data e g metadata descriptions to understand the precise meaning of that data and to translate or integrate data across systems or from different metadata vocabularies Hence it was recognized that there was a need to formally define the semantics of MPEG terms and to express these definitions in a machine understandable interoperable language RDF Schema RDF Schema Spec was the obvious choice due to its ability to express semantics and semantic relationships through class and property hierarchies and its endorsement by the W C s Semantic Web Activity W C Consequently the Adhoc Group for MPEG Semantic Interoperability was established and an MPEG ontology was developed and expressed in RDF Schema and DAML OIL extensions Hunter Adding Hunter An ROF The extensions provided by DAML OIL DAML OIL were necessary to satisfy certain requirements such as the need for multiple ranges and sub class specific constraints The basic class hierarchy of MPEG content and segments is shown in Figure below e g the MPEG class VideoSegment is a subclass of both Video and Segment Figure MPEG Multimedia Segment Class Hierarchy The relationships of the Segment types to other segment types and multimedia entities are dependent on the allowed types of decomposition Multimedia resources can be segmented or decomposed into sub segments through types of decomposition Spatial Decomposition e g spatial regions within an image Temporal Decomposition e g temporal video segments within a video Spatiotemporal Decomposition e g moving regions within a video or by MediaSource Decomposition e g the different tracks within an audio file or the different media objects within a SMIL presentation Associated with each of the subclasses in Figure are various properties which define permitted relationships between the segment classes corresponding to specific structural or organizational description schemes and the permitted audio visual and audiovisual attributes associated with different types of multimedia segments The visual and audio features which may be associated with multimedia and segment classes are listed in Table Associated with each of the visual and audio features is a choice of descriptors also illustrated in Table Precise details of the structure and semantics of these descriptors are provided in ISO IEC FCD Multimedia Content Description Interface Part Visual and ISO IEC FCD Multimedia Content Description Interface Part Audio so Table MPEG Visual and Audio Features and their Corresponding Descriptors Only particular visual and audio descriptors are applicable to each segment type Table below illustrates the association of visual and audio descriptors to different segment types The MPEG RDF Schema Hunter Adding Hunter An ROF specifies the constraints on these property to entity relationships Table Relationships between Segment Types and Audio and Visual Descriptors descriptors MPEG provides standardized Description Schemes which combine the base classes and properties above into pre defined structured relationships ISO Figure provides an overview of the organization of MPEG Multimedia DSs into the following areas Basic Elements Content Description Content Management Content Organization Navigation and Access and User Interaction Figure Overview of MPEG Multimedia DSs ISO IEC These different MPEG DSs enable descriptions of multimedia content which cover Information describing the creation and production processes of the content director title short feature movie Information related to the usage of the content copyright pointers usage history broadcast schedule Media information of the storage features of the content storage format encoding Structural information on spatial temporal or spatio temporal components of the content scene cuts segmentation in regions region motion tracking Information about low level features in the content colors textures sound timbres melody description Conceptual semantic information of the reality captured by the content objects and events interactions among objects Information about how to browse the content in an efficient way summaries views variations spatial and frequency sub bands Organization information about collections of objects and models which allow multimedia content to be characterized on the basis of probabilities statistics and ex les Information about the interaction of the user with the content user preferences usage history In the next section we generate an MPEG description of the ex le in Section which illustrates the use of the CreationInformationDS the MediaInformationDS and the TemporalDecompositionDS to provide meaningful structure to the metadata description An MPEG Description of the Ex le Ex le is an MPEG description of the ex le in Section Comparison of the CIDOC CRM and MPEG Ontologies Overlaps Intersections and Differences A comparison of the MPEG and CIDOC CRM ontologies and their descriptions of the same resource above reveals the following Both metadata models are capable of describing the creation production and classification information associated with a resource Mappings between these components of the two models is possible The CIDOC CRM is more focussed on describing physical museum artefacts and real world events from an epistemiological perspective CIDOC CRM provides an ontology which allows the decomposition of knowledge available in data records into atomic propositions that are context free interpretable when stand alone but can easily be compiled into an integrated knowledge base MPEG is more focused on precise fine grained content based descriptions of multimedia content particularly digital multimedia to enable the automated search and retrieval or filtering and retrieval of relevant multimedia content using standardized descriptions Because the CIDOC CRM vocabulary is based on a hierarchical object oriented model in which Events and Activities are core entities it provides a better underlying framework for recording the events changing attributes and dynamic relationships associated with a resource Merging the Ontologies Since CIDOC CRM is designed to provide a top level set of classes and properties which can act as attachment points for domain specific metadata ontologies it makes sense to use the CIDOC CRM as the foundation and to extend it with MPEG specific components to add multimedia metadata capabilities The obvious attachment point for the MPEG class hierarchy is the CIDOC CRM Document class as shown in Figure below Figure Extending the CIDOC CRM Class Hierarchy with MPEG Multimedia Subclasses click for a detailed image The CIDOC CRM provides an is_composed_of property which can be extended through RDF Schema sub properties to define the structural or segmentation metadata associated with multimedia resources Spatial temporal spatio temporal and media source decompositions are all provided through this approach as illustrated in Figure Figure Adding MPEG Segmentation properties to CIDOC CRM The CIDOC CRM Time Span and Place classes need to be sub classed to enable MediaTime and MediaPlace classes to be defined these are required in order to specify temporal spatial and spatio temporal locators within audiovisual resources Further extensions to the CIDOC CRM which are required for adequate multimedia description include the provision of formatting properties Table and visual and audio features descriptors Table associated with multimedia and segment entities Some formatting metadata can be accommodated by the existing Dimension class e g file size frame dimensions But formatting information such as encoding and storage medium could be attached through a new Format class and a new has_format property similar to the existing Dimension class e g Ex le Audio and visual descriptors could be provided through the provision of two new classes VisualFeature and AudioFeature Their respective MPEG descriptors as outlined in Table could be defined as sub classes The properties has_visual_feature and has_audio_feature would be required to associate these new classes sub classes to the relevant Multimedia Document types as specified in Table Based on the proposals described here an RDF Schema representation of the MPEG extensions to the CIDOC CRM has been developed and is available RDF Schema Rep Conclusions and Future Work Conclusions In this paper we have analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the CIDOC CRM and MPEG ontologies in the context of providing a metadata model for describing and managing museum multimedia resources Based on this analysis we have described an approach to merging the two models by using the CIDOC CRM as the underlying foundation and extending it through the addition of MPEG specific sub classes and sub properties to provide support for multimedia concepts and descriptions The outcome is a single machine understandable ontology in RDF Schema which can be used to provide the underlying model for describing multimedia in museums and thus facilitate the exchange sharing and integration of heterogeneous multimedia information between cultural institutions Future Work Having developed the model the next step is to test evaluate and refine it by applying it to the description and management of real collections of multimedia resources within museums We plan to do this through the development of a test bed using resources provided by the Smithsonian s National Museum of the American Indian CRC In two workshops were held by the DELOS Working Group on Ontology Harmonization Doerr to discuss and compare the CIDOC CRM and ABC ontologies Lagaozi Hunter Both of these ontologies have been designed to facilitate semantic interoperability between metadata vocabularies from different domains A third workshop is planned for June and the anticipated outcome will be a common merged model Assuming that this eventuates then future work will involve determining how the multimedia specific concepts of MPEG can be attached to or accommodated within this merged ontology Acknowledgements The work described in this paper has been carried out as part of a Smithsonian Fellowship funded by the Queensland Government and the Smithsonian Institute Additional funding has been provided by the Cooperative Research Centre for

library project to provide a common conceptual model to facilitate interoperability between metadata ontologies from different domains This updated ABC model is the result of collaboration with the CIMI consortium whereby earlier versions of the ABC model were applied to metadata descriptions of complex objects provided by CIMI museums and libraries The result is a metadata model with more logically grounded time and entity semantics Based on this model we have been able to build a metadata repository of RDF descriptions and a search interface which is capable of more sophisticated queries than less expressive object centric metadata models will allow Keywords Metadata Modeling Ontologies Acknowledgement The work described in this paper has been carried out within the Harmony

'Beers Hunter p William W Hunter p WILLIAM W HUNTER Lord Bacon aptly expressed the universal belief when he penned the lines Though kings princes and great personages be few yet there are many excellent men who deserve better than vague reports and barren elegies History is biography of men whose deeds have left an impress on the life of a nation or a people If such be an evident fact the lives of those men who have risked their all for the dear old flag are especially interesting to every true patriot and most worthy of permanent record that future generations may be benefit by their perusal The Hunter family were originally natives of Ireland where the grandparents of the present generation John and Jane Work Hunter were born and reared They were married in the old country where John had learned the weaver s trade In they sailed to America first locating on a farm adjoining Buffalo village this county He packed salt over the mountains then drove a team and afterward took a contract to build a mile of the old National pike He then bought a farm in Buffalo township successfully following agricultural pursuits until becoming advanced in years when he resumed his trade Mr and Mrs Hunter reared the following children Robert removed to Belmont county Ohio David moved to Iowa Alexander deceased in Ohio Joshua deceased of cholera in Wheeling W Va James settled in Iowa Margaret deceased in Washington county Penn William of whom a sketch follows Samuel moved West and one deceased in youth The parents moved to Belmont county Ohio and passed their declining years with their son Robert They were members of the North Buffalo United Presbyterian Church under the ministry of Rev David French The mother of Mr Hunter was born in Ireland and lived to be one hundred and nine years of age William Hunter was born in Buffalo township this county soon after his parents arrived in America receiving a meager education in the country schools When but thirteen years of age he drove a four horse team also assisting with various duties of the farm In he was married to Mrs Maria J Maher Chambers widow of Joseph G Chambers and daughter of John Maher Sr a prominent merchant and sister of John Maher Jr a leading attorney Purchasing the place now occupied by his namesake he began to follow farming Mr Hunter was a quiet undemonstrative man and was a radical Democrat though never taking a very active part in politics He and his wife were members of the Upper Buffalo Presbyterian Church Mrs Hunter was a woman of excellent mind and possessed an inexhaustible fund of general information He died March having been preceded to the grave by his wife May Their children are named Joseph C Jane William W and Joshua J William W Hunter whose name opens this sketch was born March in Hopewell township this county and attended the common schools of the vicinity until twenty years of age when he taught school in Hopewell township four years When the Civil war began he had arrangements made for studying law in Washington Penn being unable to enlist in the army having lost his right arm in a threshing machine in but he engaged as a teamster remaining in that work until March He then returned to farm life and December was united in marriage with Lizzie T born April daughter of Caldwell Smiley Their children are Joseph W John S Clarence M and Howard T Joseph W is a student at the Philadelphia Medical College Mr Hunter was born on the farm where he is now living The home place contains acres and he owns an additional tract of acres When a young man of twenty years he began contributing to newspapers having obtained a high reputation as a writer and is at present a regular contributor to the Pittsburgh National Stockman Western Agriculturist Dakota Farmer and Breeders Gazette He is regarded as an entertaining public speaker Probably no other man in private life in this county has been called upon as often to speak at religious educational patriotic and agricultural meetings He devotes his principal attention to the breeding of draft horses Mr and Mrs Hunter are members of the Upper Buffalo Presbyterian Church in which he has been an elder twenty years and superintendent of the Sabbath school for fifteen years where he is now a teacher He was a commissioner from the Washington Presbytery to the Presbyterian General Assembly at Detroit Mich in In politics he votes the Republican ticket but though often urged to do so has never allowed his name to appear as a candidate for office Joseph C Hunter a brother of William W and eldest son of William and Maria Chambers Hunter was born in on the farm in Hopewell township and was educated at the Millersburg Lancaster Co Penn Normal School graduating with the class of He fitted himself for teaching and followed that occupation until the war began He enlisted in August in Company C Twenty second Pennsylvania Cavalry and participated in all the engagements of his regiment until his death in resulting from exposure Among the battles in which he fought may be mentioned Loomy Creek Devil s Hole Moorfield Pancake Gap Petersburg Fredericksburg Monocacy Junction Cedar Creek and many other engagements Jane Hunter a sister of Joseph C was born in in Hopewell township this county receiving her education in the common schools and Buffalo Academy she afterward taught two terms of school and in was married to Hon J R Kelley who enlisted in in an Ohio regiment was discharged because of broken health in and returned to his home He represented Washington county in the State Legislature of

Privacy Updated March Software Tools for Indigenous Knowledge Management Jane Hunter DSTC Pty Ltd Bevan Koopman University of Queensland Australia and Jane Sledge Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian USA Abstract Indigenous communities are beginning to realize the potential benefits digital technologies can offer with regard to the documentation and preservation of their histories and cultures However they are also coming to understand the opportunities for knowledge misuse and misappropriation of their knowledge which may accompany digitization In this paper we describe a set of open source software tools designed to enable indigenous communities to protect unique cultural knowledge and materials preserved through digitization The software tools described here enable authorized members of communities to define and control the rights accessibility and reuse of their digital resources uphold traditional laws pertaining to secret sacred knowledge or objects prevent the misuse of indigenous heritage in culturally inappropriate or insensitive ways ensure proper attribution to the traditional owners and enable indigenous communities to describe their resources in their own words Hopefully the deployment of such tools will contribute to the self determination and empowerment of indigenous communities through the revitalization of their cultures and knowledge which colonization western laws western cultures and globalization have eroded Keywords Indigenous Knowledge Cultural Rights Rights Management Software Introduction Using multimedia technologies indigenous groups have been able to record and preserve significant aspects of their cultures including languages First Voices ceremonies dances songs stories symbols design artwork tools costumes historical photographs film videos and audio tapes NMAI Barani Diwurruwurru Documentation of indigenous knowledge and history has become an extremely important tool to ensure the survival and self sustainability of indigenous tribes and cultures and to provide evidence of past injustices and to support claims of original ownership Although digitization is ideal for sharing exchanging educating and preserving indigenous cultures it also creates le opportunities for illicit access to and misuse of traditional knowledge It is essential that traditional owners be able to define and control the rights and access to their resources in order to uphold traditional laws prevent the misuse of indigenous heritage in culturally inappropriate or insensitive ways and receive proper compensation for their cultural and intellectual property Finally it is essential that indigenous communities be able to describe and contextualize their culturally and historically significant collections in their own words and from their own perspectives In this paper we have investigated the application of IT security mechanisms to the rights management of indigenous collections In consultation with staff from the NMAI Cultural Resources Centre National Museum we have developed a set of low cost simple to use and robust software tools designed to enable the description annotation and rights management of collections of mixed media digital and physical objects belonging to indigenous communities We have also developed a search retrieval and presentation interface which retrieves different result sets depending on the user s profile and aggregates the results automatically into coherent multimedia SMIL Synchronized presentations Because of the enormous diversity of indigenous cultures the system has been designed so that it can easily be customized to support the unique requirements of specific communities The immediate future involves working closely with a small number of indigenous communities to refine the software to suit their specific requirements and projects Eventually we hope to make the software downloadable from the Internet and freely available to indigenous communities for non profit use and to provide training in its use and maintenance Background and Requirements The work described here began with an investigation of the ability of current and evolving information technology tools for rights management e g frameworks markup languages metadata models and standards to support the unique needs of indigenous communities We found that initiatives such as MPEG Multimedia Delivery Framework MPEG and XrML XrML are primarily concerned with e commerce and protecting the commercial rights of content owners They are built on the premise of modern intellectual property law regimes and the notions of individual property ownership for a limited duration ideas which are alien and detrimental to indigenous cultures MPEG and XrML do not support the specific requirements expressed by indigenous communities who need to protect indigenous knowledge or enforce tribal customary laws In an earlier paper Hunter specific extensions to XrML in the form of customary constraints were developed to support the description of customary or traditional laws which commonly affect access An analysis of tribal laws across Aboriginal and Native American communities revealed the following common factors or variables which may determine access to traditional knowledge native non native restrictions the user s membership in a particular clan or tribe the user s status within the tribe e g elder initiate child the user s role within the tribe e g dancer artist midwife healer the user s gender male female o moon menstrual cycle restrictions o pregnancy restrictions the relationship of the viewer user to the people animals or objects depicted in the resource the death of people recorded in a resource human remains access restrictions no access should be provided to images of human remains or specifics about the disposition of human remains repatriated to tribal communities the context in which the resource will be reused or reproduced Staff at the NMAI CRC also expressed the need to be able to document traditional care information associated with culturally significant physical artefacts in their custody Kristina Dunman has described the meaning and importance of traditional care of American Indian artefacts in Dunman Jim Pepper Henry Repatriation Program Manager at the NMAI also provided the following list of traditional care constraints frequently requested by American Indian tribal representatives regarding the storage and handling of objects directional orientation segregation from other objects or other tribes materials storage on higher shelves use of wooden shelving cover from view with cloth or muslin ceremonial feeding dusting with corn pollen and or other materials cleansing with smoke cedar sage tobacco sweetgrass etc freezing restriction low oxygen restriction no CO bubble or covering with plastic or other non permeable materials sacred ceremonial bundle dis assemblage restriction bundle to remain intact and unopened ceremonial pipe assemblage restriction bowl and stem should be housed disconnected Similar traditional care recommendations also apply to culturally sensitive artefacts belonging to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communitiesbut held in museums archives cultural centres and keeping places The software should also enable the traditional owners to describe contextualize and annotate resources in their own words their own languages and from their own perspectives The importance and value associated with enabling spoken annotations in addition to textual annotations was multi faceted Spoken annotation tools reinforce and support the oral tradition which is so strong in many indigenous cultures Spoken annotations are an easier and more natural interface for user input than keyboards particularly for communities with low computer literacy and poor keyboard skills Spoken annotations represent new language resources which can be used to help preserve threatened languages Photos and videos can act as a trigger for the Indigenous elders to record their stories as spoken annotations to the visual resources In addition users should be able to view or listen to associated annotations which are clearly attributed to individuals This approach supports the unambiguous documentation of all views perspectives even if they are different or contradictory The software explicitly displays who said what and when rather than displaying only the view of a Museum Curator which may have been deduced from a number of different sources of varying reliability Figure below illustrates how we envisage the software being used to assist with the protection preservation and repatriation of indigenous knowledge and artefacts which are being shared exchanged or returned from museums archives private anthropologists collections and cultural institutions back to their original owners N B We are not considering the repatriation of human remains within the scope of this project No single approach is applicable to the repatriation of indigenous information knowledge and or artefacts For ex le Australian law differs from US law and additionally each tribal community will have its own unique needs and requests In the United States while the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act NAGPRA specifies the types of objects and sites to be protected and or repatriated it is expected that some tribal communities will want access to the records of all objects in museum collections associated with their community and be satisfied with digital surrogates and access to physical objects when requested Going beyond the requirements of NAGPRA the NMAI has established a Culturally Sensitive Collections Care Program to respond to areas of concern of Native peoples with regard to the maintenance presentation and disposition of sensitive materials and information in the collections of the museum Jim Pepper Henry Assistant Director for Community Services at NMAI says This Program is to be implemented with regard to the wishes and concerns of indigenous communities and traditional leaders and structured within the boundaries of the obvious and reasonable limitations of the institution The basis for this program is formed through consultations with official tribal representatives tribal elders and traditional leaders and museum staff with respect to museum policies and procedures and US federal legislation including the National Museum of the American Indian Act American Indian Religious Freedom Act AIRFA Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act NAGPRA and the Collections Policy of the National Museum of the American Indian The Program Committee is cognizant of the fact that it is operating within the constraints of a national museum and acknowledges that in some instances dependant upon the beliefs and feelings of the Native community concerned the proposed implementation of sensitive collections care practices within the museum setting may be deemed inappropriate or presumptuous In such circumstances the Committee will endeavour to abide by any alternative direction offered by the concerned Native group The aim of the software described here is to support such a Program Figure Envisaged Software Usage Scenario The envisaged usage and application of the software as described above introduced certain requirements and design constraints which needed to be satisfied These included Security mechanisms because of the sacred secret nature of the content with which we are dealing it is essential that the IT security mechanisms which are employed be impenetrable and reliable Simple user interfaces many of the potential users of this system will have low computer literacy so simple intuitive user friendly interfaces are essential Robustness the system must be able to stand up to the rigours of unexpected input by users with little prior computing experience Low cost in order to make the software open source and accessible to indigenous and grassroots communities it must be built as inexpensively as possible using tools which are ideally free Interoperability the software tools should be built on international standards Dublin Core Dublin CIDOC CRM CIDOC MPEG MGEP XrML XrML in order to ensure maximum interoperability between disparate databases Portability it should be able to run on a range of platforms and operating systems Java JDBC JSP XML and SMIL have been used as the software development environment to ensure transparent portability across platforms Flexibility The customary laws and intellectual property needs of traditional knowledge holders vary enormously among indigenous communities throughout the world Quite often the views within a single clan can vary significantly and they may also vary over time Our system attempts to support the common notions associated with traditional laws within Indigenous communities In addition we have provided Schema editing tools in order to provide maximum flexibility and to enable easy customization of the software Scalability the size of indigenous collections particularly within cultural institutions can reach hundreds of thousands of items The software should be capable of efficiently enabling metadata constraints to be applied across large sets of resources individual resources or regions segments within resources for either individual users or user groups Although a number of other projects have investigated the application of information technology tools to the protection and management of indigenous collections according to customary laws Ara Sullivan Digital Special they have not approached the problem using international metadata standards nor developed generic yet flexible systems which are capable of supporting indigenous communities globally but easily customized to support the particular local customs The remainder of this paper describes the software which has been developed to support the requirements specified above h class SubHeader System Architecture and Components This section describes the architecture of the software system its separate components and the overall process workflow described in Figure The system consists of three major components The Metadata Editor Generator The Database The Search Retrieval and Presentation Interface Figure illustrates the interfaces to these components and the technologies used to build them and integrate them into a single coherent system Figure System Architecture and Workflow The Metadata Editor Generator This component of the system enables users to input the descriptive rights and tribal care metadata associated with the objects either physical or digital and to attach spoken or written annotations to specific objects Users require a login ID and password to run this software component and depending on their privileges user profile may only be permitted access to certain functionality Figure illustrates the three types of metadata which can be input and the users groups who we envisage will provide them Figure Metadata Types and Sources The Descriptive Metadata consists of Dublin Core Dublin plus some additional optional elements from the CIDOC CRM CIDOC for describing physical museum objects such as material technique and dimensions Figure shows the user interface for inputting or editing descriptive metadata Alternatively some or all of the descriptive metadata could be acquired from existing museum library archive database cataloguing information Figure Descriptive Metadata Input The Rights Metadata will be provided by the traditional owners or elders of the indigenous community to whom the resource belongs Only those users with the required access privileges will be able to input or edit the rights metadata Support has been provided to enable the definition and application of restrictions based on the user s membership of a particular clan or tribe the user s status within the tribe the user s role within the tribe the user s gender the relationship of the user to people animals or objects depicted in the resource the death of people recorded in a resource the context in which the resource will be reused or reproduced Figures a b c d and e show the user interface for defining access restrictions which depend on the user s tribal affiliation gender role and status Figure User Interfaces for Restricting Access According to Customary Laws In addition to the descriptive and rights metadata annotation tools which enable indigenous communities to describe resources in their own words have been provided Authorized users can input record and attach either textual or spoken annotations to specific objects or resources The ability to enter spoken annotations is especially useful and valuable it provides a natural user interface which supports the oral tradition and allows users to express their stories in their own words and languages It also acts as a trigger for generating new knowledge and enhancing existing knowledge Figure below illustrates the annotation interface Users can also browse the list of clearly attributed annotations and view listen to who said what and when about a particular resource Figure Spoken Annotation Input In response to a request from both museum staff and representatives of Indigenous communities we have also added support for the specification of Tribal Care recommendations The Tribal Care metadata tool enables Indigenous communities to define the ways in which culturally significant or sensitive physical artefacts should be treated ways which are acceptable to the cultures represented Elders are able to define particular spatial orientation storage and preservation recommendations to ensure the respectful tribal care of physical artefacts While the actual implementation of traditional care specifications may be difficult many museums are attempting to integrate Indigenous beliefs and requests into museum practices and our software will hopefully facilitate this process Figure Tribal Care Specifications Where possible the specified access restrictions will be enforced by matching them against the profile of the user Every user of the system requires a login ID and password When being allocated a user ID users will also need to provide supporting documentation to prove their claims of tribal affiliation status etc The User Manager software component illustrated in Figure allows the systems administrator to add or remove users and to edit their profiles Authorized elders will be able to enter the rights constraints and authorized users will be able to attach annotations Hence the software affects not only what resources users can access and view but also what metadata tools they can access and hence what metadata they can enter Figure User Manager Because of the enormous diversity of indigenous cultures the system has been designed so that it can easily be customized to support the unique requirements of different communities Customization is carried out through the SchemaManager tool Community elders can add new constraints or remove or refine existing constraints depending on the traditional laws of their community An XML Schema XML is saved to reflect their particular metadata requirements and rights constraints and the user interface is then generated from the saved selected schema Figure illustrates the Schema Manager user interface Figure Schema Manager The Database Saved metadata is stored in relational tables in a MySQL database which is connected through a JDBC Java Database Connectivity API Java It is envisaged that because of the sensitivity of the data this database will not be accessible through the Internet It will be stored on CD ROM or the hard disk of a stand alone supervised workstation within a cultural centre keeping place or supervised building such as a library or a school within the community In addition to the metadata which is explicitly saved to the database through the user interface meta metadata is also recorded all changes to the metadata who was responsible and the date time of the changes are recorded within the database This represents an important component of the system s built in security framework The Search Retrieval and Presentation Interface A search browse and retrieval interface to the collection was built using standard Web Browser technologies Internet Explorer Netscape for the user interface The advantages of using standard Browsers for the search interface are their familiarity and widespread availability and the lack of re engineering necessary should collections eventually be disseminated over wider networks To access the collection users must have been allocated a login ID and password and a user profile The steps below illustrate the typical procedure which users would follow when searching and browsing an indigenous collection A user logs onto the system using a secure password Associated with each user is an authenticated user profile which includes information such as tribal western names native non native heritage tribal clan membership gender status role etc The user performs a search on a particular topic e g dance See Figure The software then searches the title subject and description metadata associated with each object in the collection for the specified search term e g dance For those objects whose metadata matches the search term the software compares the objects rights constraints with the user s profile to determine whether or not the user is permitted to access this object If so then this object will be added to the result set The list of results objects which

developed as a result of consultation with representatives from Indigenous communities and staff from museums archives libraries and cultural centres in both Australia and North America However at this stage the software remains relatively untested within real world applications or real communities Hence the immediate future involves working closely with a small number of indigenous communities to determine whether the software can satisfy the unique requirements of particular Indigenous communities for the management of their culturally sensitive collections or whether further extensions refinements modifications will be required whether the dynamic political social and trust issues e g lack of agreement on access rules validation of individual claims of authority authorizations within a tribe or community are greater than the technical problems associated with enforcing them the proper procedures required to enable the successful and beneficial application of the software to the preservation description protection and annotation of indigenous cultural collections by the traditional owners the types of scenarios situations collections and communities to which the software is most suited and of maximum benefit whether additional security mechanisms such as XML Encryption XML Encryption XML Digital Signatures XML Digital SAML Security Assertion Markup Language Security SSL Secure Sockets Layer Secure Socket and watermarking techniques would be applicable and could be trusted to ensure secure access to and transfer of sacred secret data over networks between distributed remote locations and a common centralized repository Given a positive response from the community trials we plan to make the software freely available and downloadable from the Internet for non profit use by indigenous communities and to provide training in the usage refinement and maintenance of the system to interested groups Acknowledgements The work described in this paper has been carried out as part of a Queensland Smithsonian fellowship funded by the Queensland Government and a collaboration between the Distributed Systems Technology Centre and the Smithsonian s National

another article under William John Hunter s file though it is written about John s son William John Hunter it gives much about his parents From the book Cyclopaedia of Canadian Biography being chiefly men of the time A collection of persons distinguished in professional and political life leaders in the commerce and industry of Canada and successful pioneers by Rose George Maclean published Toronto Rose Pub Co Hunter Rev William John DD John s son pastor of the Wesley Church Hamilton and Superintendant of the Hamilton district was born on the th February at Phillipsburgh in the Province of Quebec He is a son of John and Nancy Hunter who were descended from the Scottish Covenanters but born in the county Tyrone in the North of Ireland They came to Canada in and settled in the Province of Quebec but in removed to Ontario John Hunter still survives and is hale and hearty at the advanced age of eighty two His wife died years ago and the three surviving sons are all engaged in the work of the Christian Ministry namely the subject of this sketch the Rev S J Hunter pastor of the Centenary Methodist Church Hamilton and the Rev H D Hunter M A pastor of the First Congregational Church London Ontario William John Hunter received a good public school education and afterwards attended Victoria University Cobourg pursuing a course in classics and metaphysics and he obtained the degree of Doctor of Divinity from the Chicago University in June Our subject has not confined his attention entirely to church work but has been zealous in the promotion of temperance which may be regarded as a sister employment Whenever the opportunity has arisen to use his voice in forwarding this great cause he has not remained silent He is at present a member of the Royal Templars of Temperance With respect to his religious convictions it need hardly be said that he has always been thoroughly satisfied with the doctrines of Methodism and is a most able broad minded advocate of the name He married on the th July Mary Jane second daughter of Isaac Robinson of Toronto Dr Hunter entered the ministry of the Methodist Church in June and during the past twenty one years he has been in charge of some of the most important churches in London Hamilton Toronto and Ottawa The Dominion Church at Ottawa was built under his direction and is one of the finest ecclesiastical edifices in Canada He was chairman of the Ottawa district for three years and secretary of the Montreal conference He is at present pastor of the Wesley Church Hamilton and superintendant of the Hamilton District It is only justice to say that Dr Hunter is one of the ablest and popular ministers in the Methodist communion of this province There remains a possibility that per son Hamilton s biography which you will see listed under him that John and family may have spent the years from time of arrival in Canada given in the above biography till in the Bytown area John shows up first in the Noyan Census then as shown below in the St Armand Census We should not discount this completely till a thorough search has been made in Methodist and Presbyterian records in the Bytown area Son Robert B s baptism may show up

and under male married to John Total children between and members British Wesleyan Methodist However they do not show up in the census for the St Armand area and recent evidence shows that they spent time in Noyan and Philipsburg between and Noyan Census Hunter John in the family under Robert male married John female under did they have another daughter married before or is she the family member absent listed in the above census female married Nancy Note that on the baptism of Son Thomas Anderson Hunter a note says his father John Hunter was currently residing in Noyan Quebec and from the baptism of son William John Hunter a note on which says his parents John and Nancy were then living in Philipsburg See article on William John Hunter above Some time between then and they seem to have

________________________________________________________________ NARRATIVE BY JANE HUNTER HODGSON This account of the life of Eva Nellie Holden was written in by her granddaughter Jane Anne Hunter Hodgson daughter of James Boyd Hunter Sources were birth and death certificates as well as first hand accounts from Eva s daughter Lillian Shuler Sillaway Eva s daughter in law Theodosia McKeeman Hunter and Paul Cottrell who knew the family in Woodburn Indiana The actual occurrences described are facts Eva s crying as she put on her bridal gown was related to Lillian by Eva herself as well as the love she eventually kindled for James Theodosia and Paul both told of her working at the Barnhill Sanatarium Some of the connecting ideas were fabricated according to the explanations given to the author by the witnesses Jane Anne Hunter Hodgson I was born on the rd of August in the year in Findlay Ohio I was the first of three children born to my parents Pearson Benjamin Holden and Flora Anne Barnhill My father operated a grist mill in Findlay and he had come from the neighboring county Putnam county to marry my mother whose family had lived in Findlay for a number of years My mother and daddy had just lived through the traumatic years of the Civil War as they were growing up Father s father had died in Grandad was a rather well known personage in this part of Ohio His name was also Pearson Benjamin Holden He was a preacher in the United Brethren Church Having been born in Virginia he took a pro slavery stance against his church body My mother and father were married and about a year later I was born I soon had a brother William Reed and a sister Jennie We grew up and went to school in Findlay We went to the Presbyterian Church where the Barnhills attended for years In my parents were divorced My mother was having a very hard time holding the family together since my father was down in Georgia and not sending any money for the family s expenses When I was about years old a man came through our town His name was James Boyd Hunter He was a furniture manufacturer in Chicago He talked about so many far away places like Chicago the big city with all of its modern conveniences He talked about Canada where he was born in a city called London I was fascinated with all that he had to say and I think he thought that I was very pretty He started courting me Because he was almost years older than me my mother tried to put a stop to his bringing me flowers That made me want to see him even more My mama said that if his intentions were honorable he should marry me and so it happened just all very fast On New Years Eve we were married I cried as I was putting on my bridal gown I think I was suddenly afraid to leave the comfort and love of my family to go with this stranger to the huge city of Chicago I was not even sure as I started down the aisle that I really loved him and I feared that I was making a terrible mistake but it was too late for second thoughts I took the plunge and soon we were headed off on my first ride away from all that I had ever known Chicago was such a big city I loved the excitement We lived just a few blocks from Jim s business He owned the furniture business with another man named McCue I soon had a new friend Mrs McCue I was very thankful for her friendship especially a few months later when I began feeling ill every morning I suspected that maybe I would have a child Mrs McCue helped me through the days when I felt so poorly and to my joy and Jim s joy Flora Jane Hunter was born on the rd of January My days were filled with the fun of watching Janie grow Jim went off to the facctory every day and also traveled around on the trains to neighboring states looking for outlets for the furniture I was busy shopping and cooking and minding the house every day When I went to bed at night I was exhausted I would fall asleep listening to the clop of horses hoofs on the streets outside It seemed that in Chicago someone was always coming or going even in the middle of the night In my mother moved to Chicago to be with me and I was thankful to have her with me My sister moved over too and Sarah Jane married a Mr Bates They lived in Riverside village Mama would spend part of her time with me and part with Jennie On the th of February we again had to call out the doctor in the middle of the night to come to the house Our second child a boy named Frederick was born Now when I walked down to the butcher shop or the fruit store I had Janie in tow and little Fred in the baby buggy A picnic in the park was sometimes a treat in those days It was not long before those familiar symptoms returned and on the st of November Hamilton Wellington was born We named him for my husband s father who had been the superintendent of schools in Toronto and London Ontario He was born in Ireland and came to Canada with his parents as a young boy In October of I told my loving husband that I suspected that child number was on the way He was delighted as always He was a great support to me and a wonderful father to his children I had grown to love him very much We had such a beautiful Christmas that year with just the perfect toy for Jane and Fred and Ham Mama met a nice man here in Chicago named Wellington Bennett and I was very happy for her when they decided to marry I will never forget that day in February It had snowed and I was stuck in the house with the children I was already getting my very rounded figure back with five months of baby proceeding as expected When the officer came onto the doorstep I couldn t imagine why he would come to my house He tried to soften the blow with his words but the shock could have killed me when he said that Jim had been found dead on a Michigan Central train here in Chicago at about noon He was taken off to a hospital and the policeman said that the doctors would have a report later on about what had happened Things had never appeared so bleak as they did on that day in What wasI to do I did send word to some good friends who had moved just over the Indiana line into LaPorte They came over and helped me through those days We took his body to the Congregational Church and buried him in Rosehill Cemetery I wondered where I could go and what I could do next My doctor said I must take good care of myself or risk losing the baby that I carried inside me I know Jim would not have wanted anything to happen to his child so I waited out the next four months there in our rented house in Chicago On the th of June James Boyd Hunter was born named for the father who would never see him grow and mature I now had my hands full and felt overwhelmed with the prospects of living without a man in the city My friend who had moved to Indiana was now in a small town called Valporaiso She wrote and encouraged me to come there So as soon as I got back on my feet after the birth I began to pack up all that I owned for the move by horse and buggy to Valporaiso Indiana It was not easy The money that the McCues sent helped but I knew that I could not raise four children on that money I began to look for some kind of work One day I met a man who was selling encyclopedias door to door He told me how he got his job and put me in touch with the people who offered me a job selling It was a struggle to balance caring for the family and working But Jane was now ten years old so she could help with the younger ones while I went off to bring in some money I tried my hand at a variety of jobs in those days It was always the most difficult to hold a job when the children were sick They of course had their share of childhood sicknesses It was always a concern when the little ones were ill I loved my children more than anything else in the world On the th of April I received word that my Mama had died in Riverside Village She had only three years of happiness with her new husband In little Fred came down with a horrible stomachache one day By the middle of the night I knew it was serious The town doctor came over early in the morning to see him He told us what to do Jane and I nursed him round the clock All of the children gathered around and tried to comfort him but when he began to burn with fever and his speech became the ramblings of delirium we were so frightened Our beloved little Fred passed away that day It was like losing a part of my own heart We were irreconcilable In we moved to Woodburn Indiana My mother s brother was a physician in Laotto and Woodburn He had a sanitarium there the Barnhill Sanatarium I felt that if we moved there I could work at the Sanatarium and things would ease up financially for the raising of my children It was becoming more and more difficult and the doctor said that he would pay for my two boys to go to Howe Military School if I came to work for him I felt this would be such a wonderful opportunity for Ham and Jim that I eagerly accepted the offer The move was made and the two boys were sent off to school I was put to work selling insurance so that people who bacame ill could be cared for in my uncle s sanatarium The years passed so quickly and the children grew up so fast In I met a man named Charles Wesley Shuler We began to fall in love and I realized that he wanted to marry me It had seemed out of the question in the past that I could marry again since I had always put my children s needs first but it now seemed to be the proper thing and I was ready to get on with my own life We were married in On the nd of August Lillian Florence was born into our family By now Jane was a grown up young lady I had saved the money to send her to finishing school We were now living on Holton Avenue in Fort Wayne Indiana Ham was attending high school Jim was just eleven years old My marriage to Charles was rocky but on the nd of December our son William was born Charles was not around much to help me with the children But I was used to managing on my own so that was not a new challenge for me I could see that our marriage would not work out Eventually we were divorced I now had Jim still at home and the two little ones I loved my children very much so continued to work and to care for them Jim was in Fort Wayne High School when the war broke out in He went off to the Navy in and Ham did too Those were long years until he returned from the war Lillian and Bill and I were so overjoyed to see them return In the early s we moved to a house on Maple Place When Jim married Theodosia McKeeman they bought a little house on the same little court across the street from us I saw my first grandchildren born Jane married Arthur Laudel and they moved to Kansas City There in Fort Wayne in those years of my life I was introduced by a friend to the Christian Science religion I knew when I learned the principles of this new found religion that God had really helped me through all of the rough spots in my life and that he was really in charge of my life and health and mind It was with jubilation that I embraced these teachings and passed them on to Lillian I told Lillian that when Jane was younger I was able to send her to finishing school I could not do that for Lillian but I believe I gave her a better gift and that was in the promises of God to his people It filled me with happiness to see Lillian grow and mature in her faith In I was married to Willard

year her first magazine feature was published and the year she learned to swim She died in but left behind many ways to know her letters manuscripts journals and with failing eyesight her last written words the day before she died With me she left indelible memories especially of her few months visit to our home in the winter of Some time on her return home she wrote back to us of being so happy to have had Iris Teta to read to Grandmother Eubank and my father were published writers of fiction and non fiction Their stories were in newspapers and magazines in the U S and Canada She and my father also shared an avid interest in ancient Egyptian culture and architecture By the time I was born the family had already selected my name it was to be Rachel Jane for my Eubank and Jones great grandmothers Daddy and Grandma however became rebels and instead gave me a name from one of their favorite works of fiction about an ancient Egyptian princess Teta who travels through time to reappear in the future as Iris Mrs Fanny D Eubank Note The Bridge of Time by William Henry Warner New York Scott Seltzer On visits to her cottage a mile or so from town we would settle outside on the porch swing and chairs or inside on the sofa and Daddy Grandma and Mama would talk about writing family politics and recent reading I would listen A year or two before we moved away my mother was our town s news correspondent to The Asheville Citizen Mims loved visiting Grandma and helping her with the garden It was Grandma who helped put together his first st and coin collection and encouraged him to continue Those first collections grew over the years into his coin investment and appraisal business He would spend a few weeks at a time with Grandma and she was so happy to have his company Often they d walk the winding road down to the main highway from the cottage pick up a few groceries at the old commissary and start back up the road About halfway along the road stood a great white rock with streaks of grey strata through it Grandma and Mims would stop to rest and have a bite to eat there That ancient rock is still standing by the road though tilted some by a dozer Houses have since been built and cars now up and down the road But the rock still has company from the bicycle riders and a sprinkling of walkers and joggers who may at times stop to rest by it The cottage is still at the top of the hill Mims died in but he leaves a daughter and a wife who continues his life long business Growing up studying family photographs I saw the resemblance between Mims my brother and Mims my grandfather I feel that in many ways my brother reminded Grandma of Grandfather Eubank whom she had divorced in and who had returned to the family two years later Grandfather Eubank died in Fanny died in They are buried side by side in a cemetery in Knoxville several miles from where they had lived some of their happiest married days Our mother s Aunt Frances at thirty the year of her marriage to D W Whisenhunt After her husband s death in during the depths of the Depression Aunt Frances completed a correspondence course in nursing and worked for thirty five years as a licensed practical nurse with private patients from among the most prominent families in Asheville North Carolina She was with us until Through the years she would visit several times a year and always on Christmas She was adventurous and daring After retirement in her mid sixties she traveled with us on several family vacations On an excursion through the western states she spent evenings writing dozens of postcards to Mrs Frances B Whisenhunt friends and family back home about the glorious landscapes she was seeing She kept up or ahead of us on tours of Washington D C and New York City where she climbed in the heat and humidity of July the spiral and narrow iron steps up to the crown of the Statue of Liberty On visits she came with a fifth of White Port packed neatly in her square black suitcase which always smelled of Cashmere Bouquet soap At some time during the visit most likely soon after she arrived she and my mother would sit down at the dining table and share a glass or two of Port They would share this rare time chuckling about one thing or another It was a special time for both My mother was eager to catch up on family news back home in Asheville Swannanoa and Black Mountain And Aunt Frances was interested to hear what was new with our family As a little girl growing up listening to their good time together I learned to appreciate the joy of good conversation Betty Jean William and Bonnie s first She was about two years old here It was and the little dress was a light aqua blue silk crepe Our mother kept the little dress like new and Betty still has it packed neatly away Aunt Hat had given it to her after Betty Jean and her mother had arrived at the Southern Railway Depot in Knoxville homesick for Aunt Frances and Grandmother Eubank Betty has always loved pretty dresses and shoes She remembers one shoe story William and Bonnie used to tell It was The Depression had worsened and William and his young family had moved back near his sister and mother William Mims had been born in January On Sundays especially Betty Jean looked forward to visits with Uncle George and Aunt Trilby George operated for his mother s family the Blacks of Myersville Pennsylvania one of the two major manufactories in town During the Depression at those times when all operations at the plant were shut down Uncle George always made sure William had an income Aunt Trilby and Uncle George s children Billy and Fanny Sue were about twelve and eight years old in It was happily customary after dinner on Sunday for all to get in the car and go for ice cream at one of the local drugstores On one of these trips Uncle George noticed Fanny Sue s shoes to be looking a little worn and said to Trilby Mother don t you think Sister needs a new pair of shoes They look a little worn At once Betty Jean stretched out her little legs to see how her shoes compared to Fanny Sue s which were said to be worn and in need of replacement Not to pass up a gorgeous opportunity Betty Jean immediately chimed in moving her feet back and forth to attract attention Well I think I need some new shoes too Everybody got a big laugh though Bonnie was some embarassed at Betty Jean being so forward William didn t actually hear Betty Jean s comment for he hadn t been able to hear well since the War But the comment was appreciated by Uncle George and Betty Jean s new shoes were delivered to the house within a few days Betty Jean recalls another shoe delivery that has stuck in her memory all these years In Betty Jean was twelve years old and growing into a young lady prissy she says with long and thick dark auburn hair When the knock came at the door Bonnie asked Betty Jean to see who was at the door Immediately Betty Jean was making her way to the door and eating a prune at the same time Looking through the door window she saw a neighbor Mr Bristol who was a supervisor at Uncle George s plant and she opened the door He had in his hands what looked to be a shoe box in wrapping paper Betty Jean your Uncle George asked that I drop this package off to you on my way home he said It was at this point that Betty Jean swallowed the prune pit Mr Bristol and Bonnie who had joined them watched as Betty Jean excitedly opened the package She barely noticed the pit going down When she opened the box resting in a nest of white tissue paper was a delicate pair of black patent leather dress up pumps She said it was the little raised heel that sent her immediately dreaming of all those parties and socials to come Those were her first pair of dress up shoes The swallowed pit and this story became a special memory Looking back now we think behind this surprise delivery there must have been a conspiracy between William Uncle George and Mr Bristol at the plant and Bonnie at home Bonnie Katherine Jones b March d February My mother would say often that the very happiest time for her was childhood free to be herself no pressure to be something for someone else just sunlight and friends Bonnie K Eubank and son George and the many cousins and the extended family who loved her In later life after she had married and had four children I knew that grown up happy time for her had come to be the apple tree the singing and the gold transformed from those carefree days of childhood I saw her lovely face dance in laughter when all the children and the grandchildren were bustling about She seemed once again spirited back to the exuberance of childhood she so often talked about She may at times have thought she left those times of joy among the meadows behind long ago But she hadn t They surfaced so often In the photo above in still lovely at eighty three my brother George took Mama for a spin in his new red sports car Jones Joshua Jones c

'Clan Hunter Wikipedia the free encyclopedia You can support Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation by making a tax deductible donation Clan Hunter From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation search Clan Hunter Crest Clan Hunter Gaelic Clann an t Sealgair is a Scottish clan which has its seat at Hunterston in Ayrshire It has historical connections with both the Highlands and Lowlands of Scotland due to several centuries of operation in some of the formerly Gaelic speaking Scottish Islands including Arran Bute and the Cumbraes where the Hunters also long held land The present Chief is Madam Pauline Hunter of Hunterson Contents History Origins of the Clan Hunter Scottish Wars of Independence Anglo Scottish Wars Post Clan Activity Clan Seat Castle See also External Links edit History edit Origins of the Clan Hunter The first Hunters arrived in Ayrshire in the last years of the th Century They were experts in hunting and fieldcraft with generations of experience in the forests of their land of origin Normandy northern France William Hunter was invited to Scotland by David I who was himself brought up in the Norman Court He must have had considerable skills to have been so honoured he was responsible for providing the Scottish Court with meat and game a position that the Hunters held throughout the Middle Ages and beyond In papers relating to the King s Inquisition in we find mention of Williemo Venator William the Hunter st Laird who was appointed as Royal Huntsman while his wife had the honour of serving Queen Matilda as lady in waiting William put his expertise to good use in the wild forests and fens then rich with wildlife which surrounded the site of the timber fortress later to become Hunter s Toun As recognition of his family s skills the title of Royal Huntsman became a hereditary appointment edit Scottish Wars of Independence The Pele Tower of Hunterston sheltered the Hunters throughout the Wars of Scottish Independence from which the Hunters emerged with their lands intact despite having signed the Ragman Rolls swearing allegiance to King Edward I of England in Having most likely supported William Wallace and certainly Robert the Bruce in the great King s grandson Robert II granted William Huntar th Laird a charter for the lands of Ardneil for faithful services rendered The Family still possess this ancient document For many years the Hunters continued to serve the Scottish Crown as Royal Huntsmen and as soldiers sometimes at great cost edit Anglo Scottish Wars During the Anglo Scottish Wars between England and Scotland in the th century John Huntar the th Chief died with King James at the Battle of Flodden Field and in Mungo Huntar the th chief died for Queen Mary at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in Clan chiefs from Clan Colquhoun Clan Macfarlane and Clan Farquharson also died at this battle A good clan chief was expected to lead by ex le which meant being first into battle at the head of the clan For this reason many clan chiefs died during battle Because of the awful number of Scottish lives lost at the Battle of Pinkie the th of September is known in Scotland as Black Saturday edit Post Clan Activity As times became more settled the Hunters devoted more time to farming their extensive lands although they still produced soldiers of distinction over the generations Gould Hunter Weston husband of Jane Hunter Weston th Laird fought in India at Lucknow in and their eldest son Aylmer th Laird was a well known general in the First World War He later became Member of Parliament for North Ayrshire During her tenure as Clan Chief Eleanora th Laird fought in the courts but lost a compulsory purchase order for land at Hunterston to build a nuclear power station The last Clan Chief Neil Hunter of Hunterston and of that Ilk along with his wife Sonia Madam Hunter of Hunterston continued the fight against industrialization He was well known for his sailing prowess and represented the United Kingdom in two Olympic Games during which he won a silver medal Like many Hunters before him he was in true tradition an expert in archery The present Clan Chief Madam Pauline Hunter of

by Betty J Evans Source of infornation Colonial families of the United Stated ofAmerica Volume II written in and information furnished by Daryllimpus in I notice John Mills Sr s wife recorded as Sarah Beals and there is a lot of confusion about that but Sarah is not the wife of the John Mills Sr who was Martha Weing s father in law I have seen him recorded with Sarah Beals on the Internet at ever so many sites and I don t know where that information came from unless someone picked up the wrong wife for John Mills Sr and sent this incorrect information in to be recorded ona WFT and others

Ewing b in Bedford CO VA Finis Ewing Rev b Jul in Bedford CO VA From Betty J Evans With the exception of a few birth dated very few or such as that none of the information comes from the internet or WFT CD S I have done all of my own research the old fashioned way since old habits are hard to kick in regard to the Ewings and my information basically comes from records found in The Ewing Genealogy with Cognate Brenches from records I have found in various history books and from a few obituaries furnished by Ewing descendants or obits from historical societies obits in connection with later generations of the family that is That isn t too say the records are without error but they are as close as I can get to the actual facts with the material there is out there to work with So many of the Ewing men were prominent politicians attorneys etc that there has been a lot written about them in the early history of our nation but finding information about the women in the family is a whole different ballgame The women present a real challenge and I hope to learn more about some of them in the future Robert Ewing the emigrant ancestor was born at or near coleraine in Londonderry County Ireland and came to America with his older brother Charles Ewing about the period Robert and Charles were said to be cousins of the emigrant Nathaniel Ewing On their arrival in America they first went to Nathaniel s home in cecil County Maryland but shortly after they accompanied their cousin the emigrant James Nathaniel s half brother to what became prince Edward County virginia Later they joined a new adventurous colony and settled near the Peaks of Otter in Bedford County virginia where they remained the rest of their lives according to The Ewing Genealogy with Cognate Branches by Kettridge Ewing The two brothers married sisters daughters of Rev Caleb Baker a prominent Presbyterian minister and his wife Marth Brooks Baker Charles married Martha Baker and Robert married Mary Baker Mary

Robert Ewing qualified as one of the Justices of the County Court for Bedford County asd was serving in and Robert and his brother Charles ranked among the better farmers of Bedford County virginia

Robert s Will dated March with a codicil dated May was filed for probate in the Bedford County Court on June reportedly naming eight sons and three daughters as heirs indicating one daughter was deceased previous to her father the deceased daughter being Sidney Ann Ewing The Will disposed of considerable land both in Virginia and Kentucky the ownership in Kentucky being explained by the fact that much of Kentucky was carved out of Augusta County Virginia Robert Ewing died in May or June in Bedford County His wife Mary reportedly died three years later in and is buried beside her husband

GRANT Kings Grant otherwise known as the Old Turner Place was built circa Located in the community of Henry Virginia it is situated on partof a tract of land originally consisting of approximately acresacquired around and a decade or so thereafter by the pioneerShadrack Turner ca and his wife Anne A Royal Land Grant from King George II ofEngland reigned this portion has remained in thedescendants possession continuously since then now almost two and ahalf centuries including the present owner Dr Harry Lee King Jr ofthe eighth generation Some of the early tract dates from a grant from the newly formedCommonwealth of Virginia to Josiah Turner I born ca forservice in the American Revolution The original document bearing ahandsome red seal and signed by President Thomas Jefferson when Governorof Virginia is still in the possession of the King family It is believed that thepresent house was built by one of Shadrack Turner s sons who latermigrated West or moved to a nearby county Constructed of thirty foot long hand hewn oak logs from twelve tofifteen inches wide with two stairways and nine foot ceilings the mainpart of the structure once had a A roof front porch a long dinning roomat the rear with another porch running its length to which was joined abreezeway and a spacious log bodied kitchen All the exterior was coveredwith white painted clapboard and accented with green window shutters Interestingly among the many outbuildings only the smokehouse remains the smoke house corncrib and chicken house identical log buildingsresembling the kitchen and located near the dwelling all boasted thesame carefully crafted decorative moldings as the main house and thecorncrib had a basement The sitting room mantel revealed an interestingfeature upon its being

page CALEB BAKER SR Family tradition states that Caleb Baker married Martha Brooks in England and as she had a grandson by the name of Brooks Baker this would seem likely to be true Caleb and Martha Baker reared a family of eight children Samuel Henry Abraham Caleb Jr Ruth Mary Martha and Ester It is not known by the writer to whom the three older sons Samuel Henry and Abraham married but Samuel s will probated in Prince Edward County Virginia March mentions his wife Christian and Children Samuel John Glover Robert Caleb Martha Ewing Elizabeth C bell and Sarah Crockett Martha married Charles Ewing Ruth married Samuel Johnston Mary married Robert Ewing Ester married Samuel Wallace of Amelia County Virginia Caleb Jr married Catherine Hodnett of Buckingham County Virginia William H Whitsitt of Richmond College Virginia writing of the Baker family states that Caleb Baker s will probated in Prince Edward County Virginia April Is a clear and informing document and is worthy of careful study in every instance in the will and sometimes in the deeds recorded in Amelia County He spells his name not Baker but Beaker that appears to have been in his view an important consideration His wife and children and neighbors had no scruples about recording the name Baker but the father could never be reconciled to that usage The circumstances appears to indicate that the name was originally the German name Becher which is the same as the Latin word Bacar and the English word Beaker and signifies a vessel for drinking wine The ancestors of Caleb Baker were probably cup bearers at some Court of high or low degree and took their name from the function which they there fulfilled The well known family name of blankenbaker seems also to refer to the same origin these who bore it feeling a special pride in maintaining their beaker in a condition of immaculate whiteness But many a Blankenbaker has found by experience that people in general have small appreciation of the nicer points in philology The descendants of Caleb Baker made a like discovery and were compelled to submit when the name should be pronounced and written Baker instead of Beaker They might have saved themselves in a measure if they had Anglicized the name in the form of Beecher but few of those who employed it in that form would be enabled to make out its original meaning It would be well however if all who bear the name of Caleb Baker could be informed of these simple facts in connection with it History is worth preserving for its own sake and the truth of it should be duly honored The American Historical

EWING ORIGINS The Ewings are of Scottish descent originally from the West ofScotland near Glasgow They were located on the River Forth nearStirling Castle in the vicinity of Loch Lomond Their religion wasPresbyterian The reproduction of the coat of arms above wasrecognized by the Hon Thomas Ewing family as coming rrom Scottishancestors near the lower middle of the drawing is Mask Ewing shortfor Maskell Ewing During the min s there was great religious persecution of theProtestants in Scotland According to the tradition of the Ewing clan the Ewings of America trace their origin to six stalwart brothers of aHighland clan who with their chieftain engaged in insurrection in in which they were defeated their chieftain captured and executedand themselves outlawed It is told that our Ewing ancestors first wentfrom their seat on the River Forth to the Isle of Bute in Scotland andthen settled at or near Coleraine County Londonderry of Ulster inNorthern Ireland On July members of the Ewing Clan took partin the Battle of the Boyne fought on the river of that name in EasternIreland In this battle King James II was opposed by William of Orangewho was fighting for the Irish Protestants The result of this battlewas the complete overthrow of James thus forcing his abdication of thethrone and establishing the rule of William and Mary The anniversary ofthis battle is still celebrated by the Orangemen or Irish Portestants Who were these six stalwart Ewing brothers Much research stillneeds to be done but at this point in time the brothers might haveincluded John Ewing of Carnshanagh Robert

he purchased acres of land lying on the Susquehanna River from Col John French Robert Baker and his son Caleb Baker paid the taxes on this property from until It was here that Robert baker and his sons were gunsmiths They were commissioned by the King of England to make firearms for the Colonies At the time of the Revolution the Bakers joined with the Colonies against England On Aug Robert Baker petitioned Jacob Taylor surveyor for William Penn for permission to erect a gun boring mill on Pequea Creek In Feb iron ore was found near the site of the Baker land Robert and his son sought and received permission to mine the ore for commercial use The ore they mined was reduced to bar stock available to gun manufacturers This was the first discovery of ore in the county and predated later gunsmith operations closer to Lancaster Robert Baker and his father before him were gunsmiths credited with inventing the Baker Long Rifle a report given to the Kentucky Rifle s Association in It seems that the Association had employed Mr Dyke to do some research for them They wanted him to see if he could find out the person or persons responsible for making the first Pennsylvania Rifles or what was sometimes called the Kentucky Rifle Mr Dyke in his report states We feel as though these early gunsmiths came into Chaster Pennsylvania or New Castle Delaware from abroad and migrated up the Susquehanna River to where the Pequea flows into it and set up shop for making guns He goes on to say that Robert Baker came into Lancaster County Court on August and asked permission to erect a gun foring mill at the mouth of Pequea Creek on his land Permission was granted Robert Baker and his son Caleb set up their gunshop and operated it until Provided by Patty McNary Greer Robert Baker Sr born some say in Virginia other records say in Pennsylvania died September in Lancaster County Pennsylvania Robert was the first to get land in Chester County Virginia Wife unknown Born about in England I need to add this in some of my very old records that a Frances Jones had written to my Grandfather Edward McNary back in the s stating that these boys of this family was made to fill the bullets for the Revolutionary War Even though they were not for Elgland and wanted to do away with taxation Patty s source The LDS Library s IGI files and Jean Wood Vore Robert Baker Sr was granted land and a gun bearing mill formanufacturing of firearms the PA rifle by the King of England RobertBaker was the first man in recorded history to design and manufacture thePA rifle At his death his son Caleb kept up the tradition and laterused the rifle to great effect in the American Revolution The rifle waslater known as the Hog Rifle and the Kentucky Rifle in Daniel Boone s day They were
