with a in Howard was one of a cluster of bright Conservative students at Cambridge around this time sometimes referred to as the Cambridge Mafia many of whom went on to hold high government office under Margaret Thatcher and John Major See Cambridge University Conservative Association He was called to the Bar Inner Temple in and specialised in employment law and planning issues In the election he fought the safe Labour seat of Liverpool Edge Hill which led to his support for Liverpool F C The late s saw his promotion within the Bow Group where he became Chairman in shortly after the general election in which he was again defeated at Edge Hill At the Conservative Party conference of he made a notable speech commending the government for attempting to curbe trade union power At this time Howard was a leading advocate of British membership of the Common Market EEC and served on the board of the cross party Britain in Europe group Howard was named as co respondent in the high profile divorce case of former s model Sandra Paul She and Howard subsequently married in her fourth marriage their son Nicholas was born in and daughter Larissa in Unlike his many Cambridge contemporaries Howard found it difficult to find and be selected for a winnable parliamentary seat and so continued his career at the Bar where he became a Queen s Counsel in In June Howard was finally selected for the constituency of Folkestone and Hythe in succession of the retiring the Sir Albert Costain He won his seat in the general election of without difficulty Career in Government Howard very quickly rose in the ranks of Government becoming Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry in with responsibility for regulating the financial dealings of the City of London This junior post became very important as he oversaw the Big Bang introduction of new technology in After the election he became Minister for Local Government On behalf of the Government he accepted the amendment which would become Section and defended its inclusion Howard then guided through the House of Commons the Local Government Finance Act This act brought in Margaret Thatcher s new system of local taxation officially known as the Community Charge but almost universally nicknamed the poll tax Howard personally supported the tax and won the respect of Mrs Thatcher for minimising the rebellion against it within the Conservative Party After a period as Minister for Water and Planning in during which he was responsible for implementing water privatization in England and Wales Howard was promoted to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Employment in January with the resignation of Norman Fowler who left to spend more time with his family Howard subsequently guided through legislation abolishing the closed shop and c aigned vigorously for Mrs Thatcher in the first ballot of the leadership contest in November He retained his cabinet post under John Major and c aigned against trade union power during the general election c aign His work in the c aign led to his appointment as Secretary of State for the Environment in the reshuffle after the election In this capacity he encouraged the United States to participate in the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro but he was soon after appointed as Home Secretary in a reshuffle initiated by the sacking of Norman Lamont His tenure as Home Secretary was especially notable for his tough approach to crime which he summed up in the soundbite prison works Howard repeatedly clashed with judges and prison reformers as he sought to cl down on crime through a series of tough measures Under his tenure recorded crime fell for the first time in over years Infamous interview on Newsnight His reputation was dented on May when a critical inquiry into a series of prison escapes was published In advance of the publication Howard made statements to assign blame to the prison service A further controversy came when a television interviewer Jeremy Paxman relentlessly asked him the same question times in all and not the widely believed times during an edition of the Newsnight programme Asking whether Howard had intervened when Derek Lewis sacked a prison governor Paxman asked Did you threaten to overrule him Howard did not give a direct answer instead repeatedly saying that he did not overrule him and ignoring the threaten part of the question The BBC subsequently revealed that the prolonged period where the question was repeated was in fact a filler to extend the interview as technical reasons meant the next segment of that night s Newsnight was not ready for broadcast While some praised the interview for journalistic toughness others including some in the BBC criticised it as a theatrical stunt The interview remains one of the most infamous in broadcasting history In the longer term its precise impact on Howard s reputation remains disputed Some suggest that it highlighted his arrogant refusal to answer the question others suggest that it highlighted his resilience and refusal to be bullied even by one of Britain s toughest interviewers However in the same interview an incredulous Paxman also asked Michael do you seriously expect to be leader of your party In a November interview see below Paxman returned to his question from Mr Howard was surprised remarking Come on Jeremy are you really going back over that again As it happens I didn t Are you satisfied now eh This was confirmed in when under the Freedom of Information Act the Conservative Party obtained documents proving that Howard did not threaten to overrule Derek Lewis citation needed First attempt to become Conservative leader After the resignation of John Major Howard and William Hague announced they would be running on the same ticket with Howard as leader and Hague as Deputy Leader and Party Chairman However the day after they agreed this Hague decided to run on his own Howard also stood but his c aign was marred by attacks on his record as Home Secretary Howard came in last out of five candidates with the support of only twenty three MPs in the first round of polling for the leadership election He then withdrew from the race and endorsed the eventual winner William Hague Howard served as Shadow Foreign Secretary for the next two years but would retire from the Shadow Cabinet in though re remained an MP Something of the night about him claims Widdecombe Six days after the Derek Lewis incident on Newsnight Ann Widdecombe his former minister of state in the Home Office made a statement in the House of Commons about the dismissal of then director of the Prison Service Derek Lewis and famously remarked of Howard that there is something of the night about him a widely ed comment that fatally damaged his bid for the Conservative Party leadership The comment was taken as a reference to his dour demeanour which she implied was sinister and almost Dracula like and related to his Romanian ancestry Melanie Phillips felt there was a hint of anti semitism about the remark Conservative Leader After the General Election Howard was recalled to frontline politics when the Conservatives new leader Iain Duncan Smith appointed him as Shadow Chancellor His performances as Shadow Chancellor won him much praise indeed under his guidance the Conservatives decided to debate the economy on an Opposition Day for the first time since coming to power After Duncan Smith was removed from the leadership Howard was elected unopposed as leader of the party in November As leader he faced much less discontent within the party than any of his three predecessors and was seen as a steady hand He avoided repeating such managerial missteps as Duncan Smith s firing of David Davis as Conservative Party Chairman and imposed discipline quickly and firmly he removed the party whip from Ann Winterton following her telling of a racist joke His performances against Tony Blair at the despatch box were more effective than those of his predecessor as leader He was perhaps helped in all this by the Conservative Party s exhaustion after thirteen years of party turmoil following Margaret Thatcher s overthrow years which had left the party more willing to unite and rally round a leader In February Howard called on PM Tony Blair to resign over the Iraq war for failing to ask basic questions regarding WMD claims and misleading Parliament In July the Conservative leader stated that he would not have voted for the motion that authorised the Iraq war had he known the quality of intelligence information on which the WMD claims were based At the same time he said he still believed in the Iraq invasion was right because the prize of a stable Iraq was worth striving for His criticism of Blair did not earn Howard sympathies in Washington DC where President Bush refused to meet him Karl Rove is reported to have told Howard you can forget about meeting the president Don t bother coming Michael Howard was named Parliamentarian of the Year by The Spectator and Zurich UK This was in recognition of his performance at the despatch box in his previous role as Shadow Chancellor Crossing swords with Paxman In November Newsnight again concentrated on Howard with coverage of a c aign trip to Cornwall and an interview with Jeremy Paxman The piece which purported to show that members of the public were unable to identify Howard and that those who recognized him did not support him was the subject of an official complaint from the Conservative Party The complaint claimed that the Newsnight team only spoke to people who held opinions against either Michael Howard or the Conservatives and that Paxman s style was bullying and unnecessarily aggressive Election In the May general election Michael Howard s party failed to unseat the Labour Government although the Conservatives did gain seats five from the Liberal Democrats and Labour s majority shrank from to The Conservative share of the national vote only ticked up by from and from However because of the first past the post British voting system the seats won in parliament for all parties did not reflect their proportionate overall share of the national vote Commentators pointed to the state of Britain s constituency boundaries that heavily discriminated in favour of the Labour Party It is estimated that changes proposed by the Boundary Commission for England would result in a gain of seats for the Conservatives with no change in the vote The day after the election Howard stated in a speech in the newly gained Conservative seat in Putney that he would not lead the party into the next General Election as he would be too old and that he would stand down sooner rather than later following a revision of the Conservative leadership electoral process Despite the election of a third consecutive Labour government Howard described the election as the beginning of a recovery for the Conservative party after Labour s landslide victories in and Howard s own constituency of Folkestone and Hythe had been heavily targeted by the Liberal Democrats as the most sought after prize of their decapitation strategy of seeking to gain the seats of prominent Conservatives Yet Howard almost doubled his majority to whilst the Liberal Democrats saw their vote fall Criticism of c aign During the c aign Howard was criticised by some commentators for conducting a c aign which addressed the issues of immigration asylum seekers and travellers when he himself was the descendant of immigrants Others point out that the continued media coverage of such issues created most of the controversy and that Howard merely defended his views when questioned at unrelated policy launches Some evidence suggested that the public generally supported policies proposed by the Conservative Party when they were not told which party had proposed them indicating that the party still had an image

Labour disappeared compared with a percentage point lead under John Major in The focus on immigration was widely alleged to have been influenced by Howard s election adviser Lynton Crosby who has been alleged to have used similar tactics in Australian elections Whether the hiring of Crosby was a good idea or not in hindsight his organisation of the c aign was credited with making the Conservative election drive much more professional and organised than at the previous election During the c aign Howard continued to impose strong party discipline controversially forcing the deselection of Danny Kruger Sedgefield Adrian Hilton Slough and Howard Flight Arundel South Downs Cash for Peerages On October Michael Howard revealed that he had voluntarily been questioned as a potential witness concerning the Cash for Peerages investigation surrounding fundraising and the election c aign He was not arrested or cautioned and is not suspected of any criminal activity Final months as party leader Despite announcing after the General Election that he would vacate the role of party leader Howard performed a substantial reshuffle of the party s front bench on the th May in which several rising star MPs were given their first shadow portfolios in particular George Osborne and David Cameron This move cleared the way for David Cameron who had worked for Howard as Policy Advisor when Howard was Home Secretary to run for the Conservative Party leadership The reforms to the party s election process took a number of months and Howard held power as leader for six months of the new parliament During that period he enjoyed a fairly pressure free time often making joking comparisons between himself and Tony Blair both of whom had declared they would not stand at the next General Election He also oversaw Blair s first parliamentary defeat when the Conservative Party the Liberal Democrats and sufficient Labour Party rebels voted against government proposals to extend to days
