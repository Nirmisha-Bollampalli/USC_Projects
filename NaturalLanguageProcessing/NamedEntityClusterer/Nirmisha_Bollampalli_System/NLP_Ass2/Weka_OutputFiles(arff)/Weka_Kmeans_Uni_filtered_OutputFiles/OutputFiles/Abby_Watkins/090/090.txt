HELPS RAISE FOR WWF THREATENED SPECIES PROGRAM Working with World Expeditions and the World Wildlife Fund WWF with the Escape to the Andes program Outdoor Australia has helped to raise for the WWF Threatened Species Program The money is used by WWF to care for the many creatures that are currently under threat in the Australian landscape WWF Australia began its work years ago focused on recovery of threatened plants and animals Over the years WWF learnt that working to recover a single species is nowhere near as useful or effective as working on a landscape scale This means developing multi species recovery plans protecting habitat and fostering wiser management of our land and water resources Today WWF s Threatened Species Program encompasses all these activities and more In Australia today there are over species listed as threatened so the challenge is significant WWF uses a flagship species approach This involves pinpointing certain species to work on whose recovery will deliver maximal flow on benefits for other species who make up part of the same ecological community Certain frogs shorebirds grassland plants and fish are ex les of our flagship species

ACROSS THREE STATES The eastern states were devastated over summer with a series of bushfires that started in November and were still burning in some areas as we went to print in late February Quite apart from the tragic loss of life and property that occurred in the towns and cities as the fires raged across three states the loss and damage to the bush and alpine areas has been enormous The outdoors community is reeling from the impact on a number of fronts Those who love the bush simply for what it is a beautiful natural zone that by and large hasn t been changed too much since European settlement are saddened and are feeling a certain sense of loss with the burning of such huge areas of our peaceful energy restoring natural environment The Mount Hay fire just one of dozens of the summer fires Photo Ian Brown The environmental impact has been significant and the extent of the damage is only now being evaluated Nick Gellie a landscape and fire ecologist says We ve lost a significant amount of biomass re sprouting will begin months after the fires but what we are afraid we ve lost is old growth and mature forest we ve lost things that characterise the snow gum country Animal losses are sure to be similarly horrifying although harder to quantify Debbie Andrew a biologist who studied the impact of the fires suggests that while plants and animals around Sydney and the Blue Mountains are in a better position to regenerate and recolonise sites because they are more accustomed to summer fires those in the alpine areas may take up to years to regenerate The statistics of the summer fires tell a dramatic story In Victoria a stunning million hectares was burnt this is a whopping of the state s parks and forests The year average for Victorian fires to late summer is usually fires that burn hectares annually this year until mid February there had been fires that consumed over a million hectares In NSW million hectares was burnt with over hectares burnt in Kosciuszko NP KNP alone This equals of KNP and compares with just hectares burnt last year in the park Access to bush areas has been seriously curtailed for a large proportion of Australian bushwalkers c ers canyoners and climbers Most of the Victorian high country and KNP much of the Blue Mountains including Wollemi Kanangra Boyd and the central areas and numerous parks and reserves scattered up and down the coast have been off limits for most of the summer Whole communities such as the paddlers of northern Victoria the walkers and canyoners who live in or visit the Blue Mountains and mountain bikers around Mount Beauty have all been left extremely frustrated as fires have kept them out of the bush Most land managers wouldn t put a timeframe on closures but it s safe to say that some burnt areas will be off limits for many months The main concern is trees falling on roads or walking tracks another concern is rehabilitation said John Ross a spokesman for the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service NPWS Ross says that previously threatened and closed areas will be progressively reopened A spokeswoman for the Department of Natural Resources and Energy in Victoria said that no roads or tracks will be closed indefinitely and that road closures are being assessed as the fire situation changes Infrastructure losses within the burnt areas have also been substantial In one go this is far and away the worst disaster we ve seen Some people are devastated to them it s just the same as having their own house burnt down said Olaf Moon from the Kosciuszko Huts Association when asked about the many huts claimed by the fires Total hut losses across Namadgi NP Kosciuszko NP and three Victorian parks currently stand at confirmed burnt another dozen or so highly likely to be lost and many more of unknown status The issue of High Country huts has been political in the past with some land managers showing reluctance to allow rebuilding of destroyed huts however this summer saw a good level of co operation as authorities threw resources at trying to save huts Some inspiring stories came to light including the NPWS RFS team who stood with their backs to the walls of Four Mile Hut to save it Literally the fire burnt right to the walls the earth around the huts is completely scorched said Moon Alina Brown and Lucas Trihey In May this website will host a series of articles concerning the ecological effects of fire with varied input from ecologists biologists and others CHECK LIST FOR VISITING FIRE AFFECTED AREAS Respect closures in burnt areas The danger from falling branches and trees is very high after a fire Erosion is also a major problem in sensitive areas as they slowly recover from fire damage Wandering stock beside roads due to burnt fences is a serious vehicle and animal risk Stay out of areas close to active fires it sounds obvious but you d be surprised at the actions of some Maintain a constant vigilance with c fires and stoves Ensure that they are properly extinguished and comply with fire bans again it sounds obvious but there have been some scary tales of negligence that have found their way to the Outdoor office Check the FIRE LINKS page on the Outdoor website Reference pages for up to date information on closures current fires and related topics STOVE FUEL BOTTLES ON PLANES NEW RULES The rules on taking c ing stove fuel bottles onto planes have been relaxed as long as some simple precautions are taken including removing all fuel and air drying the container The following is an extract from a document titled Significant Changes to the th Edition International Air Transport Association IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations These changes are claimed to have become effective January With operator approval in checked baggage only Liquid fuelled c ing stoves Provided that steps have been taken to nullify the hazard by draining and air drying the fuel container or rinsing the fuel container with cooking oil to raise the flashpoint then wrapping the fuel container in absorbent material and placed in a polyethylene or equivalent Where the liquid fuelled c ing stove is prepared in this manner it can be classified as non hazardous This seems to indicate that the operator still has discretion While reports from some travellers indicate that Qantas and Air New Zealand have been permitting fuel bottles as checked baggage it may be worth checking with your airline before you travel The full IATA document can be viewed at www cargopak com news CANADIAN AVALANCHE KILLS SEVEN Australian mountain guide Abby Watkins witnessed a huge avalanche that buried a large school group near Rogers Pass in British Columbia Watkins and her partner Rich Marshall rushed to the area as soon as the air cleared and
