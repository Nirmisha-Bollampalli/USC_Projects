s no beer only fear William Gibson My favorite thing about the Internet is that you get to go into the private world of real creeps without having to smell them The net is a waste of time and that s exactly what s right about it do a little dance make a little luv get down tonite get down tonite Tel that ditty is sticky stinkingoat PM I used to be Bitter Twisted but then I realised I m a negative creep and I m stoned thanks Kurt Which point to start on E grades even though I thought this was a bolting forum Ewbank takes into account protection difficulty in placing distance between and soundness which in my opinion is if its crap then dont put it in Ex le Serpentine originaly grade as Malcom did it ground up putting in all runners on lead which I believe still awaits a true red point second ascent But subsaquent ascents the protection was put in on abseil and whilst dogging it hence it s grade of This assumption that an E grade in front of a number would some how magically give the climber an idea of the seriousness of a route is false E grades can mean any number of things yes it can denote big fall or ground fall potential but also how stenuous the route may be or how pumpy and fiddly the gear is to place Ex le Using another HB route Welcome to Barbados Ewbank which still awaits a second ascent with protection in place let alone putting all runners in on lead E grades it would be E c or as you suggest E Get the picture or do I have to spell it out further If you get to the bottom of a climb and look up and have no idea of what you are about to get into then you have no business being there in the first place The thing is that grades in the gym and grades in the real world do not coralate and I think this is where the vast majority of the problem lies The person who can do the blue route at which ever gym which is graded gets out onto real rock pumps out half way up an because placing pro takes time and energy falls off and strips all his gear and goes to hospital true story There for in his mind its an unsafe route It takes relatively little time and energy to safely climb the blue route in the gym especially when your out to impress but years to climb to the same technical ability on Rock Climbs there is no such thing as trad climbing Rock Climbs can have bolts As for bolting D Minor I am assuming your post hex was just to see what sort of reaction you could stir up I could go on but cant be stuffed But I would however get my appathetic arse of the couch and go and chop them Other thoughts Nobody is forcing you up there Why not just top rope it if all your interested in is the moves that would require setting up an anchor which may involve runner placement P S If the latest hard man or woman cranking the desperates can only lead on natural gear does this still make them good climbers another true story Joe PM If the latest hard man or woman cranking the desperates can only lead on natural gear does this still make them good climbers another true story A good climber is whatever you reckon is good Personally I believe you must do alpine ascents of all m peaks onsight serpentine placing only pitons on lead drink beers while soloing ozymandias direct in winter and climb punks in the gym without using the chipped hold before you are a good climber James AM This assumption that an E grade in front of a number would some how magically give the climber an idea of the seriousness of a route is false of course its not a magic fix but it would still be valuable E grades won t take all the adverture or unknown factor out of the climbing As stated the E grade should be the seriousness of the lead ascent The unknown factor might be whether the route is run out on easy ground or if the gear is fiddly but on steep ground hence a safe fall etc etc The E grade shouldn t be affected solely by how pumpy strenuous a route is but more so it should be an indication of how pumpy strenuous it is to placing the gear ie most Nowra clip n go routes would be E E perhaps another ex le Sandinista would have a higher E grade than the s at the Gallery as you have to hang round place gear the concept of a good climber is even more subjective than grading systems hex TROLL PM Joe that s not as think as you silly it is the late great Mark Moorhead was well on the way minus the beer to achieving your criteria The biggest myth in Australian climbing that the Ewbank system takes into consideration The Ewbank system takes into consideration THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TECHNICAL CRUX OF A CLIMB A m grade with bolts every metre is the same as a m grade requiring tricky route finding well spaced RP placements It is that sameness which drives the retro bolting pressure mainly from the sport faction as they try to rationalise deny their reality of Why can I send on draws and yet freak out approaching when I have to start thinking about all those other considerations stuff it just whack a few more bolts in so more ons people can enjoy the climb How does the cyber cauldron manage to smell so good Luv HEX WM PM The biggest myth in Australian climbing that the Ewbank system takes into consideration The Ewbank system takes into consideration THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TECHNICAL CRUX OF A CLIMB Bzzz Wrong Or at least badly put Are you trolling or is the cauldron smoke in your eyes Shepherd guide page a number which incorporates every variable technical difficulty sustainedness seriousness ie absence and or quality of protection For ex le Bygone is technically grade but lacks protection and so the grade is bumped up to With the addition of a fixed hanger and no change in technical difficulty shock horror waddya know Bygone is back down to in the Mentz Tempest guide Ah the Ewbank system in all its glory Never knew myths were so tangible and workable James PM the Ewbank system was originally designed to take all those things into account but I am with Hex here in practise there is far too much emphasis on the technical moves other factors are not adequately compensated for hex TROLL PM grades for a fixed hanger oh dear that IS mentzal as anything Any other convincing ex les aw what about Serpentine yeah right Standing up wind of the cauldron Luv HEX kieranl PM The Mentz Tempest guide overdoes it in places How about the first pitch of Yo Yo no added fixed gear and it gets bumped up to It is glorious climbing but probably or it s certainly easier than Muldoon First pitch of Watchtower Crack gets I usually lead that pitch with one runner no matter how badly I am climbing I would call it or Joe PM Hex Dude what makes you think i am being silly Mark Moorhead well on the way to achieving the criteria really and truly I think not how many ers alpine style punks WITH the chipped hold beers on a rainy day visionary yes god no Bring on the trad elitism dude James AM Mark Moorhead was climbing rock routes within a few grades of the upper limit of the time late s early s he went missing died on an m mountain I m yet to hear of any other Australians doing the same although some have come close grade m mountains Rupert AM Andrew Lindblade and Athol Whimp Damietta AM Rupy and Simon Parsons IN the same league but not pushing the free climbing grades quite as high John Fantini Vera Wong Abby Watkins Greg Child John Muir Andrew McCauley dalai PM Parsons has climbed up to definitely in that league Lindblade has climbed up to grade James PM of course don t know why I missed those nmonteith PM Greg Child has climbed grade routes plus numerous himalyan m and big wall routes WM PM I can t argue with Keiran that Mentz Tempest have chopped and changed grades willy nilly in both directions Necrophiliac Bostok being other ex les But thats a different issue they are taking an identical set of technical sustained seriousness factors and saying previous guide s simply added them up wrong For Bygone and its new FH the equation is now different Its the ex le chosen by Shepherd and more illustrative than your hypothetical s Hex As for whether a FH is worth grades in this instance I d say hell yeah It was a death lead without now its a lovely jaunt with The grade value given to this change has to be an average of climbers so its always going to be approximate too much for bolder climbers that must be you Hex you big hard man you not enough for Hex s more ons But E grades aren t any more exact Hex my dear do you agree with James that the problem is with the implementation of the Ewbank system If so a whole new system isn t the solution proper use of the existing system is BTW the E grade system does not apply to sport routes the poms switch to French grades on their sport crags so Sandinista and Weaveworld would still end up with non comparable grades whats to be gained Enough ranting whoever you are Hexy you sure have a lot of time on your hands just doing my best to keep up hex TROLL PM Stop ranting start chanting hex TROLL PM On hex TROLL wrote The Ewbank

grades what does everyone else think Excessive bolt dependency might have something to do with it Maybe The Ho is a good high profile ex le Re Mt Buff BA apparently Nathan Hoette got spanked left right and centre Neilmont Lets just say Mr nathan didn t want to try the sharp end after his attempts on a trad route at least grades under his limit managed to spank him Luv HEX Wonderdog AM No shame in being spanked by any climb isn t the idea to back off if you can t do a route to live to climb another day So what if he can t climb trad as well as sport it doesn t make him any less of a person I
