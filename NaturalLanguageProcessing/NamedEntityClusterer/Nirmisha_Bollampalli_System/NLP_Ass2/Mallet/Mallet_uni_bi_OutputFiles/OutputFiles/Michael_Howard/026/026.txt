columnist for Bloomberg News The opinions expressed are his own Howard s Bid for U K Prime Minister Is Long Shot New Bio Says April Bloomberg With the c aign for U K prime minister in full swing the title of Michael Crick s new biography In Search of Michael Howard Simon Schuster pounds pages seems slightly unfortunate Right now going in search of Howard is like going in search of your big toe You just look down and there it is Howard is dominating television screen and newspapers in a highly personalized pitch for votes as the May election approaches Few people in Britain would be surprised to find him knocking on the door personally possibly offering to help out with a few chores around the house That s about the only unfortunate thing about this book The year old Howard could just conceivably become prime minister yet he remains a strangely unknown figure Crick has delivered the most comprehensive guide to the man yet published At the end of its pages Howard emerges as a more likeable and substantial figure than most people would imagine Crick is an able and experienced biographer whose past subjects include another Welsh Conservative politician Michael Heseltine and the Manchester United soccer manager Sir Alex Ferguson His publishers have promoted him as a kind of biographical butcher The five most feared words in the election lexicography Michael Crick is in reception says the blurb on the back jacket No Cooperation In keeping with that reputation Crick remarks in his introduction that he prefers not to have the cooperation of his biographical subjects While Howard didn t help with the biography he also didn t try to stop it Crick conducted numerous interviews with Howard s friends and family for the book Howard s family was part of the wave of Eastern European Jews who moved to Britain in the s The fact he could rise so far is a mark of how socially mobile postwar Britain had become His father Bernat Hecht who later changed his name to Howard was born in the rural Romanian district of Ruscova Visit Ruscova today and you get vivid glimpses of what agrarian life was like in Europe for most of the last thousand years writes Crick The village economy is still largely self sufficient much of what people eat and wear is produced locally Without piped water citizens still draw supplies from wells and for most homes the lavatory is a wooden hut over a hole in the backyard Many peasants wear much the same clothes and perform the same daily tasks as their forebears in medieval times President of Romania If his father had stayed put instead of moving to South Wales and opening a clothing shop Howard might be running for president of Romania His brand of right wing tax cutting policies might go down better there than they do in Britain Romania has just introduced a flat tax Howard went to the local grammar school then Cambridge University Even before attending university he was a Conservative To declare oneself a Conservative was a brave act in a town where Labour took two thirds of the vote in the election won nationally by the Tories and where almost one in ten of the workforce had no job writes Crick Like Margaret Thatcher Howard is a Conservative by ideological conviction rather than class background Howard made his career in the law and fought several elections unsuccessfully before entering Parliament in Model Wife Along the way he married well Sandra Paul was a top s fashion model who achieved the notable distinction of being the first English girl to make the cover of the American edition of Vogue for two months in a row The elegant Sandra remains one of her husband s greatest electoral assets Howard became Home Secretary in John Major s government There he shifted crime policy decisively to the right Howard saw the Home Office as one of the few departments to have escaped the Thatcher Revolution and he felt that it was deeply imbued with the culture of what he called the criminal justice establishment writes Crick He wanted to challenge its existing assumptions Liberals naturally enough hated it But Labour has done nothing to reverse his policies and most of the world has moved toward a tougher stance on crime since the early s It is to Howard s credit that he got there first He is not just a politician who thinks deeply about the issues he also thinks about how to push change through the system often a much harder task After losing the leadership to William Hague in Howard finally became leader of his party in Crick takes the fashionable view that the Conservative politician stands little chance against the formidable Blair Howard seems to be leading his party to another calamitous defeat in the impending election Crick concludes Tingle Factor Most successful politicians Tony Blair Michael Heseltine Michael Portillo Bill Clinton inspire or excite or at least interest the public he continues The nearest Michael Howard has to a tingle factor is his wife Sandra Like many journalists Crick tends to see politics as a branch of show business His list of successful politicians is revealing two men who didn t become Tory leader and two left wing politicians who though electorally successful achieved very little They are all people who were good at the show but not so good at the business The point Crick misses is that although Howard may be a relatively poor c aigner who finds it hard to connect with ordinary voters he is an effective administrator That contrasts with Blair who is a brilliant c aigner but a shambolic administrator What this biography actually tells us is that Howard would be an effective possibly brilliant prime minister Do the voters care about that We ll find out next month Last Updated April EDT copy Bloomberg L
