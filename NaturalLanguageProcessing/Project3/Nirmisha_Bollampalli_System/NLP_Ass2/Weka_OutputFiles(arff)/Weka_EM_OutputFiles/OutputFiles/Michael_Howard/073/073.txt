Howard UK Politics Conservative leader Michael Howard wants to tighten the laws to stop illegal immigrants entering Britain He is in a position to c aign for this because his grandfather entered Britain from Romania years ago illegally I ve heard the old insult about someone being willing to sell their own grandmother to get ahead but this is the first time I ve heard of someone willing to deport their own grandfather Conservative leader Michael Howard wants to introduce tougher laws on crime including ending the early release system When he was Home Secretary he released high level drug dealer John Haase from prison just months into an year sentence along with his associate Paul Bennett A member of Haase s gang Simon Bakerman imprisoned for running an hetamine factory is Michael Howard s cousin We re a very close family said Bakerman s mother Peter Gasston Saturday February comment Mr Howards ancestry is interesting perhaps if we looked more closely into the background of some of the many we seem to be welcoming with open arms Hamza etc this might be a safer place to live Perhaps we should all take a closer look at our ancestry we might not be so keen to knock back others The PM s father in law is a prime ex le of what we shoul all be aspiring to perhaps But hey were not electing him or Howard s grandad make your choice from what you have and chose the lesser liar with the smallest personal agenda John Saturday February link comment Why did Howard release two dangerous gangsters As the Tory leader calls for criminals to be kept behind bars police are investigating his role in a royal pardon for two men facing years in prison Robin Grant Sunday February link comment Drug dealer tried to call Howard as trial witness Nick Rigby Sunday February link comment And How many of the current Labour government enjoyed free state education and took part in peace movements only to later actually get into power try and trick the public into supporting war on a sovereign nation and then starting charging for access to higher education Politics is ugly full stop Brian Monday February link comment Michael Howard the Scouse GangLand Mister Big John Haase So what s NEW Haase was given the kid gloves treatment in virtually exactly the same fashion as a previous Liverpool Drugs Baron Curtis Warren And his Middlesbrough underling Brian Carrington In the

Attorney General In the event the authorities declined to prosecute Charrington But Warren was brought to trial Whereupon under cross examination he revealed that the million cocaine importation was bankrolled by the Security Service At which point the trial judge stopped the trial And directed the jury to acquit Warren SOURCE In The NAME of The LAW David Rose Vintage KillerFacts Tuesday February link comment Mr Howard wishes to withdraw from the Geneva Convention in Relation to the Treatment of Refugees Mr Howard wishes to set a a on the number of Asylum seekers that the UK can take leaving many in desperate need and in danger of death Mr Howard is selfish and without a conscience Anthony Silkoff Thursday February link comment Michael Howard is a shameless opportunist self important low life He thinks that by stirring up racial hatred among the British people he would be fit to form the next government He should remember that he is a Jew a minority class just like the other minorities The British have not given him the right to pretend that he appears to be the native Come the day that he would be treated as a minority when the British people open their eyes to his mischievous cunning ways to con them the votes Natan Friday February link comment Its a scandal that this issue concerning Howard s royal pardon for a drug dealer irrespective of Howard s family s involvement has not made the mainstream news Even if there is no suggestion of impropriety it raises massive questions about the competance of a politician who revels in his tough guy image and bleats endlessly about the early release of relatively minor offenders Yet again the Conservative press and other mainstream media not to mention the New Labour hierachy are completely unwilling to talk about the issue of organised drug related crime and politicians Remember the brief scandal concerning Lord Ashcroft the Tory peer who briefly made the headlines after the British High Commissioner for Belize wrote an open letter to the press doubting the credentials of this man for a peerage after one of his ships was seized by the US Drug Enforcement Agency Again nobody suggested Ashcroft was directly involved but under the circumstances isn t it the job of the media to ask questions in such cases Compare this non existent scrutiny of politicians to the obsessive reporting of David Blunkett s misdemeanours Sure Blunkett abused his position in a way that I m sure most politicians have at some stage or another but fast tracking a visa hardly compares to releasing a dangerous gangster less than a year into an year sentence Paul Krishnamurty Saturday February link comment I am a student and having labour as our government is very difficult Howard is a jew and we all know how jews think isreal killing innocent people even though i hate labour i would still vote for them over howard EDITORS NOTE we have left this comment in place in the interest of freedom of speech however please don t think the abhorrent racism expressed reflects anyone s beliefs apart from the commenter himself mughal Saturday March link comment Mughal your comment is truely disgraceful It is shocking to think that in people still hold such bigoted prejudices As well as bigotry your ignorance shines through from your inability to distinguish isreal from jews Anthony Monday March link comment JUST HEARD WE RE ABOUT TO HAVE HOWARD S HOLOCAUST NO MORE IMMIGRATION CON SERVE CON CLUDE CON MAN CON SERVATIVE VOTE FOR THE NEW STATE OF CON SERVATISM THE GREAT TORY STORY by MICHAEL HOWARD colin c bell Sunday April link comment there must be in the archives video footage of mr blair saying we will be tough on crime and the causes of crime Show on that video the day date and time when it was recorded Now produce a chart produced sequentially of ezzential crime statistics then and now This chart should I believe show that crime has worsened since mr blair took charge a background commentator could guide you through the chart and come to the inevitable conclusion that crime has got worse Now reshow the video clip and ask the viewer do you want to trust another five years of your life to this man The same could be cone for education education education taxation nhs etc In addition to the Iraq war mr blair has made enough pronouncements over the past eight years to totally discredit him I hope this idea will help you to get rid of this megolomaniac m bouchier Tuesday April link leave a comment name email address this will not be shown URL optional remember personal info
