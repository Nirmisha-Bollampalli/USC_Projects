Baker c and Nancy of Ashe and Macon County North Carolina and Union County Georgia Home gt Surnames gt Baker gt Hiram Baker Children Researcher List Register Report A Note about sources How to contact me Home The author Marty Grant is not related to Hiram Baker as far as can be proven It is possible that he is a son or grandson of my ancestor Jacob Baker Hiram Baker was born ca per his age of on the census His second census entry showed him as age or born ca Those match each other pretty closely Other researchers give his birth as for some reason though I don t know the source for that It doesn t match either of his census entries Hiram was born in Ashe Co NC as proven by his census entry The Macon County census taker very helpfully included the county of birth for everyone and not just the state I don t know who Hiram Baker s parents are I have theorized that he was a son of my ancestor Jacob Baker since one of Jacob s daughters also moved to Macon County I have also theorized that Hiram is a son of Thomas Baker since they lived near each other in and Hiram did name his oldest son Thomas Baker Other researchers lists Hiram as a son of Zachariah Baker which is probably based on Hiram living near Zachariah s widow in A note about DNA Test Results A descendant of Hiram Baker via his son Thomas Baker has taken the DNA test His results do not match any other Bakers yet He does not match the Thomas Baker group which is where he should be if Hiram were a son of Thomas He also does not match other descendants of Zachariah Baker though only one is in the test database so far Since there is only one Zachariah descendant in the database and only one Hiram descendant we can t draw any solid conclusions We will know more when there are two or more from each line Additional note The DNA test in question was a marker test which generally isn t enough to go on Apparently it is an match with members of the Thomas Baker group If the test is expanded to or perhaps then we will know more Since we have no real proof of Hiram s parentage some census analysis might help However due to the large number of Bakers in Ashe County census analysis doesn t really help much at all For the census Hiram would have been about years old so he should be enumerated in the under age group born All of the Baker families listed in Ashe County that year had an apparent son that age One of these could be Hiram s father Unfortunately the census taker that year only used initials so it is difficult to know who was who J Baker probably James Baker had three sons that age Z Baker likely Zachariah Baker had one son that age another J Baker still unidentified had five sons that age another J Baker probably John W Baker had two sons that age S Baker likely Samuel Baker had four sons that age M Baker likely Morris Baker bef had one son that age and finally another S Baker likely Solomon Baker had two sons that age As you can see the census does not narrow down the list of possible parents for Hiram Baker for every Baker household in the county that year had at least one son of approximately the same age In Hiram Baker would probably still be home with his parents He should have been enumerated in either the age group born ca or in the age group born ca depending on what his actual birth date was Jacob Baker my ancestor had one apparent son in each of those age groups James Baker had two sons of matching ages Jonathan Baker had three possible matching sons Thomas Baker had one matching son Zachariah Baker had one matching son Elijah Baker had one matching male and John Baker had one matching son Like the census the census does not help narrow down the suspects too much Hiram Baker married Nancy just before in Ashe Co NC George Windes a descendant of Hiram and Nancy thinks Nancy s maiden name may have been Ray He may be correct as Ray was a well known name in Ashe County and that family was associated with some of the other Baker s there However Ralphe Baker another descendant of Hiram says that Nancy was a Saunders I don t know which is correct if either I ve not seen evidence either way Hiram Baker was listed on the census very close to the Thomas Baker family could be his father On this census he was listed as Hiram Jr as there was an older Hiram Baker in the same county a cousin probably who was about years older census analysis based on available evidence Explanation of this census Ashe Co NC pg Hiram Baker Jr Analysis Male s Hiram BAKER Male s Son gt gone by Thomas BAKER son Female s Nancy Baker wife Hiram was still in Ashe Co NC for the census This time he was just two households from a widow Sally Baker She might be the widow of Zachariah Baker If so this proximity may be why some think Hiram is a son of Zachariah I can understand that census analysis based on available evidence Explanation of this census Ashe Co NC pg Hiram Baker Analysis Male s Hiram BAKER Male s Thomas BAKER son Male s Son gt gone by Son gt gone by Male s William BAKER son Henry BAKER son Female s Nancy Baker wife Female s Elizabeth BAKER daughter Hiram Baker and family left Ashe Co NC sometime between and and moved to Macon Co NC For some reason they were listed on the census in Macon Co NC and in nearby Union Co GA the same year It is clearly the same family but the listings are slightly different In Macon County they were about houses from Mary Margaret Baker Fouts daughter of Jacob Baker In Macon Co NC Hiram s married daughter Elizabeth and her husband Joseph H ton were residing with them In their Union Co GA listing they were not with them nor listed separately in that county In Macon County NC and Union County GA were fairly close together though not quite bordering each other but pretty close Hiram s family were the only Bakers in Macon County in excluding Mary Margaret Baker Fouts mentioned above census abstract Explanation of this census Note The dates at the end of each line are not part of the original census but are approximate birth years based on age MACON CO NC Page House Family TENNESSEE VALLEY Twp Enumerated Sep BAKER HIRAM M W FARMER ASHE CO NC BAKER NANCY F W ASHE CO NC HAMPTON ELIZABETH F W ASHE
