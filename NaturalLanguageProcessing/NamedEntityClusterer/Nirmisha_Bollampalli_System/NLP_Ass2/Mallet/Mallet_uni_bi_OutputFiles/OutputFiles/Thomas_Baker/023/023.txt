Dallas counties During his tenure in the Iowa legislature Baker drafted many laws in the state s first code He was elected President of the State Senate thus becoming ex officio Iowa s first Lieutenant Governor Political turmoil was the determining factor to send Baker packing for California in arriving in the fall landing first according to family lore in Benecia Baker soon moved inland to Stockton a port on the San Joaquin River By he proceeded southward to the delta land in the northern area of the newly formed Tulare County This area was rich in its forests of Oaks Sycamores and other indigenous trees Baker and his family were among the first four families to settle in the area which was later to become the city of Visalia in Tulare County Old timers and family alike credit Baker with laying out the town for Nathaniel Vice the credited founder of the town Baker s second wife died in the mid s and he not being much of a bachelor remarried at age His new bride Ellen Whalen was a young woman of twenty In Baker was elected to the State Assembly representing Fresno and Tulare counties serving in and Baker was also appointed Receiver for the United States Land Office by President James Buchanan serving during Buchanan s term In Baker was elected to represent Tulare and Fresno Counties in the State Senate serving in the sessions of Baker and his son James were taken to the Kern Island area in by Captain Elisha Stephens who led the first wagon trains over the Sierra Nevada In Baker was involved in a legislative act which created an opportunity to reclaim sw and overflow lands in the southern valley This act eventually known as the Montgomery Act offered the right to reclaim all the sw and overflow lands belonging to the state located between the San Joaquin River at Kings River Slough and Tulare Lake For this the contractors would be deeded a percentage of the recovered land This act would later become the basis of Baker s activities in the southern San Joaquin Valley Though not the original contractor Baker and a partner purchased the rights to the contract and Baker moved onto Kern Island purchasing Christian Bohna s property in Though normally a sw y area in the southern San Joaquin Valley was suffering from the worst drought since the state was settled by Americans Baker was able to construct a dam across the outlet of Buena Vista Lake to control the flow of water By the summer of due to the lack of rain and the construction of several irrigation ditches which had diverted much water from Kern Buena Vista and Tulare Lakes the area dried up After inspection of the drainage by the state Baker was issued a patent for acres of land in Kern Tulare and Fresno counties This was his part of the reclaimed land under the agreement From a portion of the land he gained in Kern County which happened to surrounded his homestead Baker laid out a community which eventually became the City of Bakersfield Now that the Bakers were settled in their new Kern Island home other people became attracted to the area and settlers started to trickle in A Stage line ran between Los Angeles and Sacramento Along its route freight loads of provisions began making their way regularly to Kern Island Colonel Baker s island became a regular stopping off place for all travelers journeying through the San Joaquin Valley With the help of Indians he cleared a place for a home garden in which he raised corn beans and potatoes His son Thomas A Baker often mentioned the fact that some of the cornstalks grew to be feet high and an ear of corn shelled an even quart By the valley was suffering from the second year of drought Until that occurrence wild grass grew in abundance between the town and the nearby hills It was so plentiful that the residents took it up in bundles hauling it off to their ranches where they used it as feed for the livestock Each year Colonel Baker stashed away tons of this grass which he used as hay not only for his own stock but for his guests animals as well Baker s Field was right on the main road between San Francisco and Los Angeles Travelers en route were able to take advantage of the Colonel s hospitality by stopping over and setting their stock out to pasture in what they naturally enough dubbed Colonel Baker s Field It was truly the only spot along the entire route save for Visalia where they could find food for themselves and their animals As was seen in Tom Baker s comments Baker and his family kept an open house policy in genuine Southern style and it was not long before they had gained a well deserved reputation for feeding and lodging travelers and their stock whether they came in the daytime or at night The Colonel and Mrs Baker warmly welcomed each and every traveler He would not only give them meals and a room for the night but he also fed the animals He never asked or accepted money for any of these services and courtesies but considered himself well repaid by the pleasure his open handed hospitality furnished him In November an epidemic of typhoid fever ravaged those living in and around Baker s Field and among the first stricken was the year old Colonel Baker So great was the grief of the stunned community he had founded that until after the funeral the following Tuesday all business and social activity was halted During his life Baker felt compelled to make life better for the ordinary citizen He was a staunch states rights advocate enough to be arrested for treason after his comments on the issue during the beginning of the War Between the States Baker had a deep seated need to bring change to the ordinary way of life on the frontier Because of this he was able to turn a malarial sw into the bustling community of Bakersfield California About
