of State James Baker is riding to the rescue of President Bush So what else is new Baker has been there many times before for the Bush family to pull their chestnuts out of the fire This time it appears he is being called to help President Bush finesse his way out of the Iraqi debacle and save face Smooth talking Baker is a master at resolving tricky situations and he does it with a smile He is the Republican co chairman of a bipartisan panel called The Iraq Study Group created last March with a nudge from Congress The group is working on a report on Iraq which may offer an exit plan as an alternative to the president s widely touted stay the course policy But it won t be released until after the November election Naturally Ultimately the report may get Bush off the hook in the no win situation in Iraq At a news conference Wednesday the president reiterated his pledge not to get out of Iraq before the job is done But Bush said he was prepared to change tactics if Baker s team recommends a switch The word tactics may be a rhetorical device to help ease an inglorious U S exit from the war now nearing its fourth year In an interview on Sunday on ABC TV Baker said in his usual manner of lawyerly obfuscation I think it s fair to say our commission believes that there are alternatives between the stated alternatives the ones that are out there in the political debate of stay the course and cut an run The phrase cut and run has become the president s favored jibe at Democrats who urge a pullout from Iraq Former Indiana Rep Lee Hamilton a Democrat is co chairman of the group One can only hope that its report will have a major impact on the floundering administration which has to contend with growing American casualties in an unpopular war and rising discontent among its own loyal Republicans in national polls Unfortunately Baker flatly rejected a quick withdrawal from Iraq on grounds that you would see the biggest civil war you ve ever seen Well what does Baker think is going on in Iraq right now Meantime Bush has rejected as just not credible a report of public health researchers that there have been more than Iraqi civilian casualties since the U S invasion in Bush is seeing some of his own party leaders turning off on the war Sen John Warner R Va Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee returned from a trip to Iraq last week and said there might have to be a change in course in three months Baker a skilled Texas political operative had served as chief of staff in the Reagan administration and as Secretary of the Treasury before becoming the nation s chief diplomat in the administration of George Herbert Walker Bush father of the president and Baker s close lifelong friend Baker is well schooled in Middle Eastern politics In his memoir Baker recalled his warning not to take Baghdad and topple Saddam Hussein after the successful Persian Gulf War fearing it would provoke a civil war that would take U S forces a long time to quell For the same reasons the previous President Bush decided against a full scale invasion of Iraq after liberating Kuwait But the current President Bush preferred to take the word of the neocon advisers who told him the invasion of Iraq would be a cakewalk Both Baker and the senior Bush are vindicated in their view by the on going chaos in Iraq But they have not sold the present president who has indicated the war will go on after he has left office On Wednesday Gen Peter Schoomaker the Army s chief of staff said that the army is planning to keep its current level of troops in Iraq through Baker has come through for Bush in the past helping to convince the Supreme Court to halt the Florida vote recount in the presidential election in For his efforts a second Bush won the presidency Meantime U S officials in Baghdad and Washington seem bent on trashing the Iraqi government blaming it for not bringing the aggressive militias under control and indicating Iraqi officials are not up to the job of running the country That s what I call chutzpah We invade and tear up a country install our style of government in Baghdad and then criticize them for weaknesses and mistakes Is that our passport out of Iraq What s more those who play ball with us such as Iraqi Vice President Amir al Hashimi who lost three siblings by assassination this year pay a heavy personal price If
