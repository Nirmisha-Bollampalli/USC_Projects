Schuster Die Zeit Herfried M uuml nkler Review Consensus Generally enthusiastic though reviews are more descriptive than critical From the Reviews Howard s panoramic glance over the major trends of war does not so much reveal the invention of peace as the ongoing re invention of war And it is quite sobering While his survey spotlights the reality of humanity s long love affair with war in the end The Invention of Peace disappointed me because there was no serious analysis about how we can get ourselves out of this self destructive addiction to war Indeed he concludes that there is little hope that we will ever be free of war John Dear America If I have any quibble with Professor Howard it is that he says too little about civil war the real serpent in this Kantian paradise L ike all the best lecturers Howard does not get bogged down in detail the only numbers in the text are dates T he felicity of expression throughout is a delight Niall Ferguson Daily Telegraph A superbly crafted essay explaining why the West would be foolish to assume that permanent peace has come upon us This essay is a brilliant reflection on the world in which we live and the potential threats to it At root Sir Michael echoes the message of sensible statesmen and soldiers through the ages you never can tell Max Hastings Evening Standard T he book shows no signs of any lack of vigour or the quiet passion which has animated most of his work a passion for peace informed by an understanding that to build peace one has to understand war fully Christopher Coker RUSI Journal Howard thinks that peace has still not really been invented in a stable form He hopes that at least Kant s seed of enlightenment survives It flourishes in this work William Shawcross Sunday Times N uuml chtern gelassen

Michael Howard s The Invention of Peace is a brief book that surveys the evolution of war and peace War appears to be as old as mankind but peace is a modern invention Howard es th century jurist Henry Maine to begin the book It is this invention of peace and how it has been affected by the changing face of war that Howard focusses on Beside the introduction the book is divided into four parts examining ever smaller windows of history and the nature of war and peace in those times The first covers the period to the second goes up to the third to while the fourth looks simply at A D War was always messy expensive and easily got out of any sort of control But successfully waged war can bring great benefits including ridding one of pesky potential attackers War was and to a surprising or so Howard perhaps not so surprising extent still is commonplace Peace brings obvious benefits with it There is a lot to be said for the stability that peace allows including but not limited to the economic benefits of being able to better utilize limited resources rather than wasting them all on instruments of war Nevertheless the idea of peace is a relatively new one Howard suggests that if anyone could be said to have invented peace as more than a mere pious aspiration it was Kant Around the same time as this notion of peace began to spread wars also became more horrific Generally contained and limited before the French revolution not only loosened the purse strings but released manpower on a scale that made it possible to field large armies Following Napoleon there was a great incentive and an historic opportunity to achieve some sort of peace in Europe There was also a desire on the part of most of those involved to see to it that there was a balance of power that would help prevent further wars There were conflicting views as to how to go about this as Howard describes but a new order was established It made for a fairly successful peace lasting near a century with only a few European hiccoughs along the way After that came of course the Great War followed closely by another war to end all wars With the end of the Cold War where peace was held in the balance by the superpowers it remains to be seen whether the current order promotes peace or ultimately pushes us to war again The world has changed with one of the greatest changes being as Howard notes the erosion of the nation state Supranational entities and multinational firms wield increasing power And Howard maintains that many states that have become nations since have not developed as nations at all in part because they never had to go through that essential rite of passage of fighting for independence Howard suggests several threats to peace not the least of which is simple boredom Peace is artificial intricate and highly volatile he reminds the reader and the world does not seem up to entirely it Howard s book has a decidedly western focus a point he himself acknowledges Certainly the European and American wars of recent centuries have taken the greatest toll and had the most impact Nevertheless especially at this time small simmering regional conflicts seem the dominant forms of war from the former Yugoslavia to Chechnya to the myriad inter African conflicts that is where peace is at its weakest A bit more focus on this would have been of interest The Invention of Peace is a brief survey covering a lot of material fairly quickly Howard raises interesting points and he presents his arguments well but one does wish for more exposition as can be found in some of his other works It may not be an age for peace but apparently it is an age for concision Still a worthwhile little book Return to top of the page Links The Invention of Peace Profile Books publicity page Yale
