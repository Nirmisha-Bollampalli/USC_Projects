Halifax Co VA in page Vol Old Churches and Families of Va by Meade He was an Ensign then Captain in the Colonial Troops from Halifax Co VA in the French and Indian War There are numerous deeds recorded in Halifax Co made by Captain Thomas Calloway Capt Thomas Calloway and his family moved to North Carolina about and settled in what was then Surry Co later Wilkes Co now part of Wilkes Co has been taken for Ashe Co He and his sons were in many struggles during the Revolutionary War Draper MS After the Revolution he and his sons William Joseph and Thomas Jr went to South Carolina They were living there when the first census of US was taken Page Dis Draper MSS Kings Mountain Pitts Heroes page Captain Thomas Calloway and his son Thomas Jr later returned to North Carolina where Capt Thomas died in February in Ashe County The old Calloway Plantation bordered on the South fork of New river near Obids in what is now Ashe Co NC the old burial grounds are on the slope to the river and Capt Thomas Calloway was buried there His grave is marked with a rough stone shaft with letters T C chiseled on it by Daniel Boone From The Beginnings of the Calloway Family page He settled in Halifax Co VA in He was an Ensign then a Captain in the Colonial troops from Halifax Co VA in the French and Indian War the fact that he had previously become an Indian trader probably brought about his military promotions The same may be said concerning his brothers Colonel Richard Calloway and Colonel William Calloway In the Indians were very troublesome At this time the three brothers were called upon to go into active service with their volunteer companies The Black Water Fort was assigned to Richard Calloway the Pig River Fort to William Calloway and Hickory s Fort to Thomas Calloway For a period of three years these three Calloway brothers guarded the frontier of nearly fifty miles They always discovered the Indians first fired among them and made them scatter like wolves In the french Indian War had begun and Captain Thomas Calloway served under the command of George Washington during the conflict After the French and Indian War Thomas Calloway resigned his commission as a military officer and returned to private life Pittslvania Co VA had been formed prior to this time for he had served as appointment as high sheriff of that county after He owned thousands of acres of land there but was crowded out by a company of men who had land warrants that over lapped some of his holdings The King and parliament favored those of great wealth so it was useless for an individual in moderate circumstances to make an appeal For this reason he sold off the rest of his land and emigrated to Surry Co NC in and settled on a branch of the Yadkin river This was the spring of the Great May Frost On May the frost was so heavy that no one had ever seen a frost like it at that time of year the frost was so severe that all vegetation that had life was struck dead Thomas Calloway hesitated at first to take part in the war Revolutionary War He could hardly think of separating from the Mother Country He hoped for reconciliation after the Battle of Lexington of April and until the Battle of Bunker Hill June at which time George Washington took command He Calloway had taken many commissions under the King s authority and this fact involved an oath of true loyalty to the crown of Great Britian A p hlet by Samuel Adams convinced Captain Calloway that the King himself had become a rebel in that he no longer protected his subjects but that he had sent fleets and an army here to kill and destroy us and that several acts of parliament had declared us out of his protection He instantly declared himself a Bostonian a title used by people later known as Whigs and he his sons and sons in law volunteered in to defend their country this was when he was seventy six years of age and was too old to command forces So they gave him an honorable discharge Colonel Cleveland is said to have told him he ought to charge the army with everything they used observing that the individual could not hurt the public but the public could soon ruin the individual but he Thomas Calloway reportedly replied that the public chest was poor too and both public and individual had to bear a part Children of May Baker and Thomas Callaway are i Mary Callaway born Unknown She married James M

for William Callaway From Callaway Family Association Journal page DR DRAPER s ACCOUNT In his Kings Mountain and Its Heroes Dr Draper tells us Ch p et seq that the Old Fields belonged to Colonel Cleveland and served in peaceful times as a grazing region for his stock and there his tenant Jesse Duncan resided On Saturday April accompanied only by a negro servant Cleveland rode from his Round About plantation on the Yadkin to the Old Fields where he spent the night Captain William Riddle a son of Col James Riddle of Surry county both of whom were Royalists was at that time approaching Old Field from Virginia with Captain Ross a Whig captive and his servant enroute to Ninety Six in South Carolina Captain Riddle s party of six or eight men reached the home of Benjamin Cutbirth some four miles above Old Field on the afternoon of the day that Cleveland arrived at Jesse Duncan s and abused Cutbirth who was a Whig and suffering from wounds he had but recently sustained in the American cause Riddle however soon left Cutbirth s and went on to the upper end of Old Fields where Joseph and Timothy Perkins resided about one mile above Duncan s Both these men were absent in Tory service at the time but Riddle learned from their women that Cleveland was at Duncan s with only his servant Duncan and one or two of the Calloway family Riddle however was afraid to attack Cleveland openly and determined to lure him into an ambush the next morning Accordingly that night he had Cleveland s horses secretly taken from Duncan s to a laurel thicket just above the Perkins house where they were tried and left But it so happened that on that very Saturday Richard Calloway and his brother in law John Shirley went down from the neighboring residence of Thomas Calloway to see Col Cleveland where they remained over night On the following Sunday morning discovering that his horses were missing Cleveland and Duncan each with a pistol and Calloway and Shirley unarmed went in pursuit following the tracks of the stolen horses just as Riddle had planned Reaching the Perkins place one of the Perkins women knowing of the ambuscade secretly desired to save the Colonel from his impending fate and detained him as long as she could while his three companions went on Cleveland following some little distance behind She also followed retarding Cleveland by enquiries until his companions had crossed the fence that adjoined the thicket where they were fired upon by Riddle s men from their places of concealment Calloway s thigh was broken by the shot of Zachariah Wells but Duncan and Shirley escaped Cleveland dodged into the house with several Tories at his heels There he surrendered on condition that they would spare his life but when Wells arrived he swore that he would kill Cleveland then and there and would have done so had not the latter seized Abigal Walters and kept her between him and his would be assassin Riddle however soon came upon the scene and ordered Wells to desist after which the whole party with their prisoner and his servant were speedily mounted and hurried up New river traveling mostly in its bed to avoid being tracked in case of pursuit Two boys of fourteen and fifteen Daniel Cutbirth and a youth named Walters had resolved to waylay Riddle on his return to Benjamin Cutbirth s and rescue whatever prisoners he might have with him but they were deterred from their purpose by the size and noise of Riddle s party as they passed their place of concealment that Sunday morning Riddle s party got dinner at Benjamin Cutbirth s where one of Cutbirth s daughters was abused and kicked by Riddle because of her reluctance in serving Riddle s party After dinner Riddle s party proceeded up the bed of New river to the mouth of Elk creek where the new and promising town of Todd now flourishes at the terminus of a new railroad now building from Konarok Va Cleveland meanwhile breaking off overhanging twigs and dropping them in the stream as a guide to his friends who he knew would soon follow in pursuit From the head of the south fork of Elk they ascended up the mountains in what has since been known as Riddle s Knob in what is now Watauga county and some fourteen miles from the place of Cleveland s captivity where they c ed for the night Meantime early that Sabbath morning Joseph Calloway and his brother in law Berry Toney had called at Duncan s and hearing firing in the direction of Perkins s home hastened there but meeting Duncan and Shirley in rapid flight they learned from them that Richard Calloway had been left behind for dead and that Cleveland was either dead or captured Duncan Shirley and Toney then went to notify the people of the scattered settlements to meet that afternoon at the Old Fields while Joseph Calloway rode to Captain Robert Cleveland s place on Lewis Fork of the Yadkin river a dozen miles distant His brother William Calloway started forthwith up New river and soon came across Benjamin Greer and Samuel McQueen who readily joined them and together they followed Riddle s trail till night overtook them ten miles above the Old Fields where Calloway and McQueen remained while Greer returned to pilot whatever men might have gathered to engage in the pursuit of the Tories Greer soon met Robert Cleveland and twenty others at the Old Fields and all started at once reaching Calloway and McQueen before day Monday morning John Baker joined Calloway and McQueen to lead the advance as spies or advance guards and soon after sunrise the nine men who were in advance of the others fired upon Riddle s party while Cleveland tumbled behind the log on which he was slowly writing passes for his Tory captors But Wells alone was shot being hit as he sc ered away by William Calloway and was left as it was supposed that he had been mortally wounded Riddle and his wife mounted horses and escaped with the others of his band Cleveland s servant who had been a pack horse for the Tory plunderers was rescued his master Captain Ross Riddle s Virginia prisoner was rescued Shortly after this Riddle captured on Kings creek at night two of Cleveland s noted soldiers David and John Witherspoon who resided with their parents on Kings creek and spirited them many miles away in the mountain region on Watauga river Here they escaped death by taking the oath of allegiance to the King of England and were released but as soon as they reached their home David hastened to notify Col Ben Herndon several miles down the Yadkin who with a party of men under the guidance of the Witherspoon brothers returned and captured Riddle and two of his noted associates Reeves and Gross sic Goss who were taken to Wilkesboro and executed on the hill adjoining the village on a stately oak Mrs Riddle who seems to have accompanied her husband on his wild and reckless marauds was present and witnessed his execution Wells had been captured and hanged by Cleveland a short time before P xii

birth of John Renta Baker in to the birth of Andy Baker in England It does not seem prudent for me to try to duplicate what has already been done What I will do as I enter this data through these six generation is to enter data where the facts are not in agreement You will find some disagreement The researcher will be able to take a look for their own evaluation Byron Brown January History used

heard of this little piece of information from anywhere It may give us a clue to our English side Jean jvore acsol net new e mail Subj ROBERT BAKER Date PM Pacific Daylight Time From jvore iti net Jean Vore To BBrown aol com BBrown aol com Here is the Gist of the article The article was found a book published by the Tennessee Historical and Genealogical Society The article goes The first known ancestor of the Bakers of Hancock County was Robert I of England Who was the King s personal Knight at the round table The king gave him his daughter as his wife and many riches and bestowed him with a coat of arms The Coat of Arms consisted of the castle with three roses in the yard The article goes on to say that Andrew of was the descendant that came to America Then it tells about Robert and the rifles and his being in the Rev War Editors Note Robert died in but many of his descendants were in the Revolutionary War Editors Notes In the two above notes from Jean Vore we possibly see a generation back from Andrew Andy Baker as son of a Robert I of England personal Knight of the King More new information to uncover BB September Editors Note Delbert L Collins has researched this family for over twenty years has over individuals in his data base His research goes four generations up from Andrew Andy Baker to Simon Baker born Faversham Kent Co England Maybe Robert Baker personal Knight of the King will be found in the future Byron Brown January I believe our Baker family came from Kent Co England which would coincide with Andy s birth place of Buckinghamshire Co The reason I say this there is an Elizabeth Baker in my husbands family no parentage mentioned but she married a Scott and they lived at Scott s Hall Kent Co England Someplace else wish I could remember I read about our Baker family and this Same Elizabeth Baker showed up both having the same birthdate and year I have never been able to connect them exactly but there is a connection between my Husbands Elizabeth Baker and our Baker family Also to be able to gain permission to set up a Gun making company in this country would take permission of the King Queen and that family would have to be very close to the King a Knight or perhaps a relative For Elizabeth Baker b and her husband Sir Thomas Scott b were both connected to the Royal family Elizabeth Baker being his second wife The first known ancestor of the Bakers of Hancock Co Tn was Robert st of England Who was the King s personal Knight The King gave him his daughter as his wife and a castle and many riches and bestowed him with a Coat of Arms the Coat of Arms consisted of the castle with three roses in the yard The earliest known American ancestor was Andrew Baker b at Buckinghamshire England came to Boston Ma His son John Baker was b in Ma and immigrated to Pa His son Robert nd b Va d Lancaster Co Pa Where he was granted land and a gun boring mill for the manufacturing of firearms the Pa riffle by the King of England Robert Baker being the first man in recorded history to design and manufacture the Pa rifle At his death his son Caleb kept up the tradition and later used to great effect in the American Revolution The rifle was later known as the Hog Rifle and the Kentucky Rifle in Danel Boone s day Child of Andrew Baker and Unknown Wife is i John Baker born Abt in Mass died Abt in Lancaster County PA I believe don t hold me to it that I received most of my Baker information through the George W Baker s son of John Renta family who was my ggg grandfather and his son s family Judge Samuel Baker who was my gg grandfather As you will note in the genealogy sheets that George W together with several of his children including Samuel Baker moved west into Missouri with Samuel later moving to Iowa I do not have any proof of Andrew Baker of Buckinghamshire coming to this country his birthdate nor of his even staying here The puritans quakers kept good records It is my opinion at this time that he did not stay in the colonies but returned to England else there would be death records and burial records in one of the Churches I do not believe that our Andy Baker was an indentured Servant for this reason In order to come to the Colonies from you had to sign an allegance to the crown You could bring with you servants but no indentured servants were allowed during this period I am not sure when indentured servants were allowed into the colonies but know for sure it was not during the above periods Also on the ships passenger lists Servants were listed not all by their names but were listed as Servants of say SMITH John etc I know that the Severns family a knight for the crown did bring with him and his new bride servants but was not allowed additional servants until after But they were also sent by his father so were not considered indentured They were free men and women Not to be confused by being made a Freeman an oath taken by many of the Colonist during that period Taking the Freeman Oath meant you had to be an upstanding member of the community and be an active member of the local Church The Oath merely was swearing your allegence to the Crown here again in the Colonies and you were then afforded the title of Mr Mr was the highest title ever to be held in this country That is why George Washington said it was proper to call him Mr President no more no less It still rings true to this day Maggie I read about Robert I in your recent update of the Baker family and this is not the first time that I have heard of him In Hancock County Tennessee and Its People Volume there is an article by Bobby Earl Baker a direct descendant of the Pennsylvania Rifle manufacturers He also gives information about his line of ancestors that may add to your website He writes The first known ancestor of the Bakers of Hancock County was Robert I of England who was the King s personal Knight at the round table The King gave him his daughter as his wife and a castle and many riches and bestowed him with a Coat of Arms The Coat of Arms consisted of the castle with three roses in the yard The original name was Becker or Beaker meaning a vessel for drinking wine The Bakers may have been cup bearers at some court of higher or lower degree The earliest known American ancestor was Andrew Becker b at Buckingham England who came to Boston MA in His son John Baker was b in MA in and then immigrated to PA His son Robert II was born ca VA and died in Lancaster Co PA where he was granted land and gun bearing mill for the manufacture of firearms the PA rifle by the King of England Robert Baker was the first man in recorded history to design and manufacture the PA rifle At his death his son Cleb note Caleb Linda kept up the tradition and later used the rifle to great effect in the American Revolution The rifle was later known as the Hog Rifle and the Kentucky Rifle in Daniel Boone s day James Baker brother to Caleb and also son of Robert II was the first man to acquire

Frances Stephenson More About COLONEL JOHN BAKER Lived In Lancaster County Chester Counties PA Maggie The Only way to prove if they did exist in this country during the s in either in Massachusetts or Pennsylvania is to seek out Church records The colonist kept very good records I d give a lot to just jump on a plane and go to MA and PA to search these church records Unfortunately Doctors won t let me fly If indeed our Baker s belonged to one of the Churches they would be recorded I do believe that if they were here in the s they would have entered this country as a Quaker I do believe that if they had not been Quakers and entered during the time period they would have been stoned LOL So let s say they were not Quakers but merely pretended to be same they still would have been recorded in the church records There appears to be too much information regarding the Birth place of John Baker b Born in the colonies would be only two locations Virginia Boston MA possibly Salem but doubtful So that leaves Boston MA as his birthplace and his birth record That being the Old North CAgain I am too long winded Hubby says I can t say hello to anyone in less than minutes LOL As I said above I would give a lot to find these answers Children of John Baker and Francis Stephenson are i Samuel Baker born Unknown Notes for Samuel Baker Baker Samuel worked with his brother Robert Baker Lancaster

Patty Greer To BBrown aol com I ve got a little time before I finish my Christmas dinner All my family is snowed and Iced in and we are getting sleet now I have your last or letters hear in front of me ever thing that I have found indicates that Robert and Samuel was Brothers Where Samuel family is I sure would like to know In my Settle line there is a very interesting thing or court records It seams that in Westmoreland Co Va during the Sept court session There was a suit against a Samuel Baker that had married Mary mother and widow of William Strother Since woman could not have a say in court her husband John Settle done it on her behalf Mary father died and they had a plantation Mary mother remarried Samuel Baker Mary died and Samuel was not to give the Settle Children there part of the Plantation that he took over when he married widow Strother I wish I knew her name but I don t have time to work on it right now This case is in the Orders Westmoreland Co Va Samuel had to give Mary and Sole Williams part of the plantation There is mention of a half Sister It is in the old writing and very hard to understand Now this could not be Robert Son for the dates is way off This land was in Northumberland Co upon the south side of Herrin Creek Beginning at the said mouth of the creek south half a point to a marked Black walnut tree standing in a clear field Don t you know it there today from thence East northerly upon the Herrin Creek northwest along the said creek to the place where it began being opposite the land of W Thomas Vause and my Mary Srother was born in England Now what I fine very unlikely or why what happened Robert Baker Sr died before Sept based on his son taking thing over form his father death Now John Baker his supposed Father Died in all in Lancaster Co Pa Son and father both died the same year Robert no will John no will No ship names for these men when they came over hear I also fell these Baker John Robert Sr had more children than just that one child Maybe not the same wife For a woman was just to have children and clean there home and work in the fields as the old saying went one on her apron strings one in her arms and one in the oven That made them a man so they through If she died we got another one to take her place or leave them to raise there self so I fell there a lot more of these children in this part of the family I heard a long time ago that there was boys and girls in England one of the boys left England and went to Germany then later on one of his children came to America Now it may not be all hear say Maybe a few facts In all of this I know that my line does come out of the gunmakers I also know that there are another line not Baker that had a Patent on the Ky rifle Merry Christmas Patty and Raymond Greer of

Samuel worked with his brother Robert Baker Lancaster Co In Robert bought out Samuel s interests Excerpts from GUNSMITHS OF LANCASTER COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA by James B Whisker Nearly all studies of the Pennsylvania Kentucky long rifle assume this distinctively American rifle was invented in Lancaster County sometime in the second quarter of the eighteenth century We find a number of pre Revolutionary War gunsmiths who may have made Pennsylvania Kentucky long rifles We have no idea what the early Baker files may have looked like c Lancaster County was formed out of Chester Co an original county of the Province of Pennsylvania on May Several of the Baker gunsmiths in the Pequea Valley had worked and died before the formation of the county ROBERT BAKER gunsmith Robert Baker was a gunsmith between and at the confluence of Pequea Creek and the Susquehanna River in Chester now Lancaster County In Robert Baker took over the shop operated by his brother Samuel Baker Robert died intestate September the Orphan s Court ordered an inventory of Robert s estate It showed tools of the gunsmith and blacksmith The total value of the tools in his gun barrel boring and gun shop was pounds Editors Note Based on all information found I believe Samuel Baker his brother Robert Baker were probably the first gun makers in America National Geographic Magazine stated that the Baker s invented the Pennsylvania Kentucky Long Rifle Unable to find the date of that article Excerpts from A RECORD OF THE BAKER AND BUFORD FAMILIES with Allied Lines by KATHERINE BAKER JOHNSON The first of this family in America appears to have been Robert Baker who settled in Conestoga Township Chester County Pennsylvania This township became Lancaster County in as this family does not appear on the tax list of any of the other townships it is possible that the settlement in Conestoga was the original home of the family from their arrival in America Abner Baker Great Grandson states in his Life Book that this family came to America from England in the early part of and that three brothers Samuel Andrew and Caleb were gunsmiths with a grant from the King of England to manufacture arms for the colonies The first record we find of Robert Baker is the administration of his estate dated Sept Robert Baker died without a will and his son Caleb Baker was appointed administrator of his estate along with these original papers at the Register s Office at the Court House in Lancaster County is the Administrators Bond and inventory and the administrator s accounts the bond was signed by the administrator Joseph Higginbotham and Tobias Hendricks sureties and witnessed by Douglas Baker and Joshua Lowe The inventory enumerates chattels harvest crops live stock and acres of land this was signed by Tobias Hendricks David Jones and Joseph Higginbotham appraisers Amount the creditors were the names of Caleb Baker Robert Baker Jr and Douglas Baker ubj BAKER RIFLES Date AM Pacific Daylight Time From jvore iti net Jean Vore I have heard that a Baker rifle was found at the Alamo I have never seen it but the story goes when the historians at the Alamo were going through excess items on of those was a Baker Rifle that went down with the Tennesseans Also Ruth Burket s e mail is rburket hotmail com She has the unlucky family of both Bakers and Bollings She is from John Rentas family GOOD BAKERS BAD BAKERS BY CLYDE N BUNCH Kd vqd juno com My Aunt Lillie Baker Allen was born on Sacker Creek in Clay County Kentucky in She died in Lexington Kentucky in at the age of Her father George W Baker was born in Owsley County in and died at burning Springs in Clay County in The family shortly after his death moved from there Lillie was just a young woman at the time the love for the mountains and its people remained with her until the day she died This lady and her remarkable memory started me out Baker hunting Often when I talked to Aunt Lillie about her family she would refer to them as Good Bakers Bad Bakers It wasn t until after her death that I began to understand what she was trying to tell me She told me that her grandmother Ibby Baker was a Baker before she married She said the Ibby was a schoolteacher and that she went to Buffalo Creek in Owsley County to teach Here she met and married Jackson Baker Jackson died in leaving Ibby and their small son George After the death of her husband Ibby returned to Clay County and lived with her brother She died a year later Her son George W Baker was adopted and raised by her brother William Baker and wife Elizabeth Parker Aunt Lillie wrote me a letter one time about the Bakers on Buffalo Creek in Owsley County These were the one s she called Bad Bakers She said her father received word from his aunt Martha Gabbard to come up to Owsley County that the family had sold some land part of which belonged to his father His aunt went on to tell him that she was holding his part of the money from the sale for him Aunt Lillie said We didn t want him to go We thought it was a Catch We thought they were trying to get him up there to kill him To the relief of Aunt Lillie and the family her father George made the trip to Bull Skin and returned home safely I once asked Aunt Lillie where the Bakers came from She said They came from Liverpool England they were gunsmiths and that they came to this country to make guns for the colonies At the time Aunt Lillie told me this I paid little attention Of all the great things Aunt Lillie told me this statement would prove the most important She died without me having the opportunity of telling her what I learned about this unique family So I would like at this time to share my story with you We begin our story with Abner Baker first County Clerk of Clay County Abner was born in Prince Edward County Virginia September He came to Kentucky in and first settled in Garrard County where he married Elizabeth Buford He was appointed Clerk of Garrard County in and held this office until he moved to Clay County in Abner Baker kept a records keeping book throughout his life he called his Life Book In this small notebook he kept records about his family You can imagine my surprise when I read the following statement taken from this book Abner Baker stated that there were three brothers Samuel Andrew and Caleb who first came to America They were gunsmiths with a grant from the King of England to manufacture guns for the colonies He goes on to say that his grandfather Caleb Baker and his family removed from Lancaster Pennsylvania bought land and settled in what was then called The Backwoods in Amelia County Virginia on Buffalo Creek Was this just a coincident or were Aunt Lillie and Abner Baker talking about the same Baker family A Mr Samuel E Dyke a researcher in Lancaster County Pennsylvania finally convinced me I was on the right tract when I came across some writings This was a report given to the Kentucky Rifle s Association in It seems that the Association had employed Mr Dyke to do some research for them They wanted him to see if he could find out the person or persons responsible for making the first Pennsylvania Rifles or what was sometimes call the KENTUCKY LONG RIFLE Mr Dyke in his report states We feel as though these early gunsmiths came into Chester Pennsylvania or New Castle Delaware from abroad and migrated up the Susquehanna River to where the Pequea flows into it and set up shop making guns He goes on to say that Robert Baker came into Lancaster County Court on August and asked permission to erect a gun boring mill at the mouth of Pequea Creek on his land Permission was granted Robert Baker and his son Caleb set up their gun shop and operated it until It was at this time Robert Baker died His son Caleb Baker continued to operate this gun shop until the family moved to Amelia County Virginia The above Caleb Baker was the grandfather of Abner Baker first Clerk of Clay County Although Abner Baker is the one of the most interesting of people he is not the subject of our story I only used his statements and those of Mr Dyke to establish the fact that some of the Bakers now living in Clay and Owsley Counties can trace their ancestor s back to these early Pennsylvania Bakers Abner Baker in his Life Book stated that his grandfather Caleb had two brothers Andrew and Samuel Baker These two brothers would prove the most adventurous of this Baker Family In the early s Andrew Baker John Cox Enoch Osborn and several other neighboring families in Pennsylvania set out on a westward journey This journey eventually led them into the Yadkin River Valley in present day Wilkes County North Carolina This small group of Pennsylvanians would be among the first to settle in the area Some of these people settled along the Yadkin River others of the more adventurous nature crossed the Blue ridge Mountains and settled along New River in what is now Ash and Allegheny Counties North Carolina No white man had attempted settlement here before New River was known at the time only by it s Indian name Saxphaw It was here along the south branch Andrew Baker made his first home Andrew Baker remained in the area of New River until about He then decided to push even deeper into Indian country He moved down New River into what is now Grayson County Virginia very near the North Carolina line Here Andrew staked out a large track of land he called his Peach Tree Bottom track But the next summer he and his family were run out by the Indians He returned to his prior settlement on New River where he would remain for the next ten years or so He did however make one other attempt to settle his Peach Tree Bottom track This was in or This time he encountered another problem In Andrew s long absence Dr Thomas Walker a surveyor for the Loyal Land Company had staked and claimed the Peach Tree Bottom track for his employers He had to now purchase a acres of his original claim before he could resettle on it again It seems that it just wasn t meant to be The following year he was once again forced out by the Indians and back to his old settlement One might wonder why Andrew was so determined to settle this particular track of land The answer lay in what was on and in this land more so than the land itself For you see one of the largest iron ore deposits in this area was discovered on the land I think Andrew Baker and at least one of his sons were involved in the Iron business His son James Baker and he built several large iron furnaces along Cranberry Creek a tributary of the south branch of New River The remains of some of these Iron Furnaces can be seen even today They were at their peek production during the Revolutionary War The Balance of this article THE GOOD BAKERS THE BAD BAKERS by Clyde N Bunch is found in notes on John Renta Baker in this site Editors Note It is interesting that a Thomas Anderson Sr from Kentucky was with General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans and stood next to another Kentucky sharpshooter who shot General Puckingham from his white charger The general thought he well out of range but underestimated the accuracy and range of the Kentucky Long Rifle After the battle Thomas Anderson walked back to Kentucky only to find that his family had moved to Dubois County Indiana So he just walked on over to Indiana Two of his sons John and Thomas Jr married two of my GG aunts daughters of David G Nancy Brittain Brown in DuBois County Indiana Byron Brown January Wins Battle of New Orleans Jackson was then ordered to defend New Orleans Finding the city foolishly ignoring its danger he quickly put it under martial law and rallied the citizens to prepare for attack To build up his small regular army he recruited frontier riflemen from Tennessee and Kentucky and organized a force of raw volunteers free blacks planters and pirates headed by the freebooter Jean Lafitte see Lafitte This was the awkward force of some that Jackson fused together Beyond the crude American r arts of cotton bales lay British regulars These were veteran troops who had fought in Europe s Napoleonic Wars Beginning late in December they bombarded the American defenses setting the cotton bale r arts afire Between skirmishes and shellings Jackson s men doggedly threw up earthen breastworks On Jan with only contempt for Jackson s amateur army the British troops charged It was a slaughter Wave after wave of the charging redcoats fell before the grapeshot and rifle bullets of the grim American defenders Shattered the British withdrew having suffered casualties including three generals Jackson s casualties that day were only See also War of The tragic mistake of the battle was that it was fought after the peace had been signed days earlier Dec ending the war In that era of slow communication news of the peace did not reach Jackson in time to prevent the conflict From Compton s Interactive Encyclopedia Deluxe The Learning Company Inc COLONIAL FAMILIES OF PHILADELPHIA In April or early in May Philip Syng had surveyed by his order and to his use two Hundreds acres of land upon the west bank of the Susquehanna River at a place known as The Mine This tract was within the bounds of Pa but it was claimed by Philip Syng and Co under a Maryland title A complaint having been made by Robert Baker and James McClean before Francis Worley Esq a Justice of the Peace for Chester County Syng was committed into the custody of the Sheriff of Philadelphia by the warrant of Sir William Keith Baronet the Governor who had met Syng at Patterison s on April and threatened to have him punished if he presumed to make any survey of the land in question Editors Note It is believed that this Mine is where the ore came from to make Baker guns Editors Note Robert James Baker the gunsmith must have more than one wife I have changed birth dates of all children according to dates found in Patti Greer s file Editors note Some researchers report that Robert Baker was ordered to go to England to make guns for either King William or Queen Anne according to time frame In America these two Wars with France were know as King Williams War Queen Anne s War They covered the period from late s He returned to America with a grant to make guns for the Colonies This is why some other researchers think Robert Baker was the first of this line to come to America which was actually the time of his returning to his native soil Some say he came from Liverpool England He may have on his return from making guns probably teaching cutting of rifling in barrels to others while there Robert Baker settled in Conestoga Township Chester County PA later Lancaster County PA He bought acres of land on the Susquehanna River from Col John French in This seems to be time frame of his return to America so we might assume that he was ordered to England by Queen Anne whose War dates were This land was located on mile from the junction of Pequea Creek and the Susquehanna River Robert s son Caleb paid taxes on this land from until Robert and his sons were gunsmiths and were commissioned by the King of England to make fire arms for the Colonies Later the Bakers would join the Colonies against England in the Revolutionary War August Robert Baker had Jacob Taylor Surveyor with permission from William Penn lay out a site for erection of a gun mill See Taylor Papers From Pattie Greer file In February iron ore was found near the site of the Baker tract From Pattie Greer file Robert Baker left no will and his son Caleb was appointed administrator of his estate dated September Caleb Baker being part owner of the business and oldest son took over and operated it until when he sold out to Jacob Godin The list of children

German names Caleb Baker Robert s oldest son always signed his name Beaker possibly spoke with a German assent Growing up in a predominantly German speaking area may explain this trait Page The speaker refereed to the assessment list and the English on the list included Robert Baker Excerpts from a letter to Mrs Katherine Baker Johnson February written by Lettie M Bausman Record Searcher The Province of Pennsylvania was an English possession and so all people who were subjects of the King of Great Britain had free access into Pennsylvania No account was taken of them hence no ship lists Now your Baker name is straight English I believe Caleb was raised here in Pennsylvania and his association with German neighbors may have caused him to acquire a German accent Robert Baker was

ANDREW BAKER is thought to have moved into Ashe Co NC in The French and Indian War forced him to leave the area but he is supposed to have returned about A study of loose papers at the North Carolina Land Grant Office gives some added information On April ANDREW BAKER made an entry for a tract of land on the South Fork which was surveyed a week later In these papers reference is made to the line of his former survey and to his old survey Since it is known that entries were being made for land just to the south in the McDowell Co area in early there is every reason to believe that ANDREW BAKER had returned to the New River once the threat of Indians had abated The first white inhabitants of Ashe Co were the hunters It has been estimated that a hunter could earn as much as to dollars per season in hunting and trapping game for pelts It was a love of this income and the hunt that compelled many men to live their lives on the fringes of civilization Capt John Cox is ed as saying he could remember only cabins from the lead mines Fort Chisewell to the head of the Watauga But the land entries of are replete with references to places such as George Collin s old c Martin Gambill s old c William Howell s old cabin Sizemore s c BAKER S CAMP Charles Collin s old c and John Robinson s cabin By when Ashe developed into militia districts political power appeared to be resolving around locations one in southern Ashe in the area of Boone with ANDREW BAKER a justice of the county court and Captain of the Militia the political leader and the second in the northern district centered around Penington s Mill located on Grassy Creek just south of the Virginia border with Micajah Penington a justice and Captain of the Militia the political leader of this area Both Micajah Penington s and ANDREW BAKER S roles in power were short lived It is believed the Penington s were Quakers and were not considered ardent enough Whigs In Sept Micajah s estate along with a number of friends was considered confiscated although there is no evidence it was ever sold In a list concerning the status of several justices prepared by Benjamin Cleveland Colonel of the Militia on Oct th only William Colvard was acting in his capacity as Justice of Ashe Co George Morris had resigned James Tompkins refused to qualify Thomas Elledge Abner Smalley and Micajah Penington were listed as Tories and ANDREW BAKER was reputed to have taken protection of the enemy It is not known how accurate Cleveland s judgement was concerning these people ANDREW BAKER was appointed a road overseer in June and about a decade later both Penington and BAKER were Justices and Penington was also a Captain of the Militia Excerpts from an oral presentation by William Doub Bennett on August at the workshop sponsored by The Virginia Genealogical Society and The North Carolina Genealogical Society held at Peace College Raleigh NC First Settlement on the Upper New in Virginia In when the Bournes

Indians about BAKER returned approximately ten years later bringing reinforcements the Cox Osborne and Hashe families This settlement by BAKER and associated families illustrates a typical pattern These groups did not move into the public domain in ignorance of their exact location but rather like the children of Israel they sent their Calebs and Joshuas ahead to spy out the land and prepare the way Certainly Andrew BAKER was a Joshua on the New River frontier After his initial essay when he came from the Yadkin Valley in the s but was driven back by the Indians he returned about with enough people to make a permanent settlement Probably Andrew BAKER was related to the Samuel BAKER whom Ramsey identifies as operating a public mill on Davidson s Creek in the Yadkin Valley in this

be from that marriage She would have been when she had her first child However little is known about John Bolling and Elizabeth Lewis I have an old genealogy that has no author on it that says John and Eliz Lewis had girls names unknown Mary would fit in this family just fine I got a letter recently that said Eliz Lewis had at least one girl and died in childbirth Did that child live I know I am out on a limb but I have put Mary Mollie in that marriage She would have been considered a sister to Benjamin and would be the right age for an early marriage Editors Note It is reported by Pattie

think I have read everything about him that has been published this will have bearing on my theory Proof In Colonial America as per English Law it was illegal for any white man to marry an Indian Punishable by death This rule had one exception It was legal in the Virginia Colony Sanctified by England since Pocahontas was of Royal blood You will note in all the Bolling records that no Bolling left Virginia prior to the Revolutionary War Except Mary Molly Bolling The Randolph s married heavily into the Bolling Family When the Revolutionary War became evident the Randolph s including their Bolling Spouse and children left Virginia and returned to England After they War the returned to the United States Historical fact documented in many places The Randolph s returning to England had a profound affect on Thomas Jefferson as his mother was a Randolph and his Uncle that had raised him was a Randolph and the Randolph property abutted Thomas Jefferson s It was not until after the Revolutionary War that the Bolling s moved to other States in the Union except Mary Molly Most of the States in the United States did not prohibit the marriages of Indians and Whites Mary Molly could not have identified herself as being part Indian or it would have been a death sentence for her her husband and her children Also I now believe that Mary Molly Bolling was a daughter of John Bolling and Mary Kennon The birth date is right I do not believe her to be the daughter of Robert Bolling and Jane Rolfe But rather the granddaughter of Jane Rolfe and Robert Bolling Below are some notes from the Jones Family regarding their connection to Pocahontas This site also gives additional Pocahontas genealogy e g her grandparents etc It was the last sentences that got me thinking now that is sometimes a dangerous thing Notes for MATOAKA POCAHONTAS POWHATAN In John Rolfe and his wife Pocahontas in company with Sir Thomas Dale also of the company ventured to England to show off the Princess to the King and Queen While in London she gave birth to their only child a son Thomas Rolfe Not long after this Pocahontas died at Gravesend John returned to his beloved Virginia with his young son and when Thomas was old enough to attend school John sent him to England for that purpose and he took lodgings and was under the care and tutorship of his uncle Henry Rolfe Thomas thereafter returned to his home in Virginia and settled on a large estate in old Henrico County now Chesterfield above where Petersburg now is He married Miss Jane Poythress and by her had one daughter Jane Rolfe before his untimely death The American Colonies of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries all had stringent laws prohibiting interracial marriages Because Pocahontas and John Rolfe were married very early in the seventeenth century with the approval of the then Governor of the colony and because Pocahontas was of royal albeit aborigine blood the statutes in Virginia made an exception in their case The laws of the other colonies however were very strict and the punishment was severe Thus Thomas Rolfe was safe but only in Virginia or back in England He chose to return to Virginia to claim the vast amount of land Powhatan had given the couple when John and Pocahontas married When Jane Poythress died after bearing an only daughter Thomas Rolfe is reputed to have left Virginia and moved to North Carolina where he is also reputed to have married again With the laws of North Carolina so strict both then and during the next century or so it is understandable that Thomas would never have mentioned the fact that he was half Indian nor would that information have likely been passed down in the family tales If in fact Thomas did remarry after he left Virginia and sired a number of male children it would be reasonable to assume that one or more of them returned to the motherland particularly if they knew of their ancestor s ethnic background and were therefore nervous about remaining in the colonies For a full view and additional genealogy regarding Pocahontas visit the site listed below Click here http www angelfire com co family Maggie From MaggieCal To BBrown Hi Byron I show

and dates thoroughly the names you sent me appear to be what I have Since I didn t have all the DeBolling names in my data base I checked the LDS site and they had exactly what you sent me The appearance of Mary Molly as the daughter of Robert Bolling is not surprising Would feel better about it if the Stith family was not so adamant about her not being the daughter of Ann Stith And also the fact that Robert and Andrew never mention Mary Molly She seems like a nice lady to me The Quary goes on LOL Maggie Subj Re Fwd Bolling family Date AM Pacific Daylight Time From abo airmail net Bud Bolling Reply to abo airmail net To CIDDAD aol com BBrown aol com BollHall aol com Byron Good to hear from you again And this gives me an excuse to make you show up at the next reunion Actually we have tons of stuff on Benjamin Bolling and you will read of the results of our long Benjamin Study in the next newsletter Though we aren t loaded with data on Molly born about and married Andrew Baker around we know quite a bit about the long relationship between the Bolling and Baker families Though we are still working on authentication we have enough authenticated evidence for me to tell you the following story The immigrant Robert Bolling had a younger son named Edward who was born in Edward met and married a girl named Slaughter we think her first name was Mary when he was still a teenager He also became a ship s captain for Col Byrd while still in his teens Edward and his wife had a son named Benjamin who was born in in Virginia A year later Edward died at sea at the mighty age of twenty three There is strong evidence that Edward s widow left VA shortly after Edward s death and settled in NC We also believe that the Baker family had also settled there because it was at this time that we first see unions between Bollings and Bakers and this habit continued for more than one generation An ex le of this is the fact that Benjamin Bolling Edward s son had a son who married Martha Baker and the names are connected by marriage even after some of the folks migrated to Kentucky Because of Molly s birth date I am personally unable to identify who her parents might be She was too old to be a child of Edward Bolling and too young to be a child of Edward s son and therefore a sister to the renowned Benjamin about who we talk so much To help me out I am turning to the fellow I have selected as the greatest authority on the Benjamin Bolling line That is Chet Bolling a descendant of the two Benjamins and a student of the line for almost half a century Chet has been under the weather recently but if he knows the answer as to who Molly s parents were you can bet that we ll get a quick answer by e mail In the meantime I must admit that I cannot pin down the parents of Molly Bolling Baker although I am aware of the close relationship between the two families We ll just have to wait and see what Chet has to say See you in Richmond next August Bud Wm Kennon Sr was a great uncle to Mary Bolling Baker The Kennon s and the Bollings owned over acres in the Amelia and Henrico Counties Land Office Patents and Grants It is not known when Andrew Esq came to Virginia with his brother Caleb or perhaps with his brother Douglas who bought acres in Amelia Co on both sides of Spring Creek off the Buffaloe River in L O P G of Va page Andrew and Mary Molly Bolling were married around since their son Elijah was born in History of Virginia Baptists Mary s mother Elizabeth Lewis Bolling died when she was very young in and her father had remarried In the s Andrew moved his family to the New River Valley in North Carolina in what is now Ash and Wilkes County The Baker s Cox s Osborn s Boone s and several other families with roots back to Pa moved their families where no white man had been before In Andrew moved his family north again to what is now Grayson County Va He staked out acres and called it Peach Tree Bottom In the family was ran out by the Indians so he moved his family back to the New River Settlement In Andrew went north again with several families to make a permanent settlement at Peach Tree Bottom The Loyal Land Company owned by Peter Jefferson of Thomas Jefferson Thomas and David Meriwether and Dr Thomas Walker now owned this property Andrew had to buy acres from them In Andrew sold his land to Jeremiah Harrison Chronicles of the Scots Irish Settlement in Va New River Frontier Settlement on the Va and N C Border by Paula Hathaway Anderson Green On July Andrew bought acres in Prince Edward Co on the branches of Spring Creek adjoining Smith and Grymes property Land Office Patents and Grants page The Smith s were relations of Mary Bollings This would mean that Andrew had moved his family back to where Caleb Baker and the Bollings

the William and Mary College Quarterly vol no April pg It does get confusing some time First let me say with absolute conviction that no girl child of Robert Bolling England VA and his first wife JANE ROLFE the granddaughter of Pocahontas and John Rolfe Jr has ever existed From their marriage ONE and only ONE child was born named JOHN Bolling b January Virginia and he died April Virginia This son JOHN and his ONLY wife MARY KENNON had only ONE son and FIVE daughters This lineage is known as The RED Bolling s i e Indian Blood descents Next ROBERT Bolling raised his son for three years after the death of JANE Rolfe six months after birth of John She died of Typhoid and had been looked after by visits of particular Indians related to Pocahontas and they looked after baby JOHN with visits until after the third marriage of Robert Bolling in December Until this marriage happened Robert raised John with a Nannie in his household The third marriage for Robert happened with Anne Dade Stith d o John Drury Stith Their descents are known as The WHITE Bollings NO Indian Blood Child and son JOHN married in to MARY KENNON VA and the marriage is recorded From this ONLY marriage one and only one son was born and he was named JOHN Bolling born VA There are sisters to this JOHN Bolling Jr who grew up a privileged life in Colonial America He did have one big vice and that was he John Jr liked women He also liked to drink and party but he followed in his father and grandfather shoes as a Member of The House of Burgess the ruling political body of Colonial America This John Bolling Jr inherited all his Father and Grandfather holdings and property which had become massive with thousand of acres purchased and given by the Indian Nations to Robert Bolling and wife Jane Rolfe the Granddaughter of Pocahontas and the only living daughter heir of her father Thomas Rolfe b in America before any trip to England but after death of Pocahontas in at Godsend England he Thomas was left to be raised by Uncle Henry Rolfe the younger brother of John Rolfe Jr who lived in London Henry raised Thomas and the Royal Crown of England then trained Thomas to be a military officer At the age of Thomas opted for a military career in Colonial America and was sent to Virginia in as a Lt in the English Military Thomas Rolfe had total of three wives and the older brother of JANE ROLFE b VA was

STITH d o John Drury Stith During this three year period and a few years thereafter the Indian Nations have recorded relatives of Pocahontas that continued contact with ROBERT and his son just as they did during the very short marriage of JANE ROLFE to Robert JOHN BOLLING was the only heir to Pocahontas in as her ONLY living Great Grandson of this historical descent status OTHER older TWO Grandsons
