Re ouray ice festival hmmmm okay an update So far the Ouray experience reminds me alot of the Snow White fairy tale Except in this version there are like twelve or fourteen dwarves there is ALOT more beer nobody works snow white wears pasties and swings ice tools the bald dwarfe has a handlebar mustache you know subtle differences that help us avoid copywright infringement Some things haven t changed though everyone is up at AM every morn in spite of the tubular webbing they may wake to find themselves restrained with yes I m serious and we all walk happily to our day whistling and carrying axes and picks Just a big happy twisted smelly family And insite of whatever anyone else says Martha absolutely DOES know Jack Matter of fact I saw a picture of her looking right at his ASS Quite the attentive belay there Skibbs _________________ my brain s the cliff and my heart s the bitter buffalo tradkelly Adrenaline Junkie Joined Apr Posts Location Littleton CO Offline Posted Sun Jan pm Post subject Re ouray ice festival Oh but far better is the shot of Jack looking up at Skibby as she starts up the ice Jack is a far wiser man than most of us Why didn t we think of holding womens clinics There were so many um opportunities Yes we will be volunteering next year hopefully in the good name of RC com What sort of clinics can we offer I see perhaps Intermediate Ice Belaying for Women How to Meet Male Ice Climbers Ice Swimsuit Photography Actually we ll perhaps volunteer the group next year for a day of helping out with admin and support avoid the crowds on ice for a day get free admission to the free food and beer venues many many thanks to our bestest hostesses Beer Girl and Pizza Girl and pro deals on the sponsor gear The rest of town is winding down right now but Reno and Elvislegs are back from a beer run and the RC condo is going nuts still How the Sharpie just went all zen on us and stacked four beer bottles on a plastic pizza tent Others are now begging to get on here I ll post some more photos here in a few minutes Geo has something to say I m being hounded for access _________________ tradkelly http www geocities com tradkelly reno Board Monkey Joined

a B Double E Double R U N and while we had to drive to Ridgeway miles up to get beer it was worth the drive We returned to see various climbing gear stickers placed everywhere bottles coffee mugs even the chicken we had for dinner Crazy madness all of it Despite the fact that the Townhome Indoor Balcony Dry Tooling Comp is under way Tradkelly sent it with style using a repeating series of Figure moves and some strong arm work I m heading out in search of Pizza Girl With a little luck a lot of beer and perhaps a promise of riches and lavish gifts maybe she ll run away with me Ah Pizza Girl

completes the first ascent of Pizza Girl s Spicy Pie M It was promised and it happened Hence the need for paint And drywall mud The sleeper sofa wasn t damaged too badly Figure s across the traverse section were the most efficient way to complete this problem Not since the Ice Fest mixed comp yesterday did we see this many cool moves Oh my Oh my Pizza Girl It took us a minute but it was unanimous in the end Except for Sandbag of course but he runs to the beat of a different metronome And Geo likes Beer Girl That s okay we like her too We ll let you decide though This is one of the best two new routes put up at this ice festival this year bar none other And you re missing it you sad sacks _________________ tradkelly http www geocities com tradkelly tradkelly Adrenaline Junkie Joined Apr

Girl And Beer Girl Did I mention Pizza Girl touched me two nights ago at the beer and dinner benefit for the park And when Sharpie and I went to the slide show and more free beer benefit tonight I got to draw her a beer from the keg graciously provided by our friends at New Belgium Oh my goodness gracious Sakes alive Pizza Girl she s the one on the right you dipsh ts at the festival today checking us out along with the other competitors of course but we were the closest ones wearing our sexy sharp pointy stuff Or is Geo right Is Beer Girl the friendlier one maybe that s just that she was pouring us free beer for the last three days where it s at Here s Beer Girl at the rave last night happily sending me another We ll leave it up to the jury If you vote wrong we ll track you down and pin you up with ice screws Get it right the first time guys We need Jasona s story of how he got a new hat from Beer Girl before the votes start rolling in though _________________ tradkelly http www
