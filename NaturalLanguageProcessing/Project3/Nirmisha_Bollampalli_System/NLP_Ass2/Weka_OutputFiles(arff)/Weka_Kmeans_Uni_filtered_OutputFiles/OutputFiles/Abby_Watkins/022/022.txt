Gripped News gt gt June July World News The Machine Spanish climber Ram oacute n Juli aacute n Puigblanque has been described by Steve McClure as just a climbing machine a block of muscle with technique thrown in unfairly Puigblanque has spent this spring climbing on rock before his focus turns to the upcoming World Cup season and the world of plastic His performance should serve as a warning shot to his rivals Arriving in Siurana Spain after a winter s training the Spaniard quickly polished off two longstanding projects Puigblanque warmed up by sending Chikane c in six tries a project bolted years ago but which has repelled all previous attempts at redpoint Next up was an old project of Dani Andrada a line parallel to La Rambla Estado Critico a m route with long moves on bad crimps gave Puigblanque a bit more trouble requiring approximately attempts for the redpoint Puigblanque feels Estado Critico to be d and the second hardest route in the area just after his own La Rambla extension Slab Technician Bain De Sang d at St Loup Switzerland has been repeated by Italian Alessandro Lamberti According to Lamberti the near vertical route with very technical climbing and a boulder problem crux at the top required much more fine tuning and co ordination it has to be climbed much more serenely and with less rage an approach in marked contrast to other high end steep sport routes he has done Lamberti is unsure of the grade of Bain De Sang but feels that the V boulder crux which arrives at the end combined with the lack of fast repeats pushes Bain De Sang beyond the realm of c V Trade Route In the three years since Fred Nicole s Dream Time V at Cresciano was established the problem has gone from being the world s most difficult to a journeyman problem albeit a journeyman problem for the world s elite This spring saw ascents by Italian Mauro Calibani and American James Litz Amid all the ascents come charges of chipping and manipulation from none other then Fred Nicole Nicole states that Cresciano and Dreamtime in particular has fallen victim to over enthusiastic cleaning with steel brushes and said some must have used more than a brush However Malcolm Smith a recent ascensionist has countered that he has tried this problem on a number of occasions since its first ascent and I think if there are changes then they must be very subtle indeed I have not noticed a marked difference in the size of the holds or the difficulty of the problem Smith also stated that I think that what can happen over years and after thousands of brushings and hands is that the holds can change organically McClure Becomes Grit s Elder Statesman Briton Steve McClure best known for his cutting edge sport routes has turned his attention toward gritstone and its associated traditional ethos The result is Elder Statesman the ar ecirc te to the left of Elder Crack a longstanding last great line that has rebuffed the efforts of many of Britain s best climbers The line starts via the original crack and launches out on to the ar ecirc te at three quarter height McClure gains an edge near the corner via a heel toe cam in the crack putting him in a fully horizontal position before launching out around the corner in a violent swing to latch a bad hold on the face and easier ground McClure hesitates to assign a grade citing his inexperience with gritstone grades but the route is likely to be at least E which translated to a or harder trad line b Onsight Spanish climber Patxi Usobiaga has shown he is in fine onsighting form for the upcoming season with a week long spree in Alquezar and Laroanna Spain Usobiaga kicked things off with an onsight of B rated at a b and Desafiendo Newton a Then proceeded to link Desafiendo Newton with Tsunami b a route he had done previously Impressively Usobiaga completed the linkage on his first attempt to produce Desafiendo Tsunami c d If the rating of B eventually settles at b it will stand as the first b onsight _Andre Cheuk return to top News Smith Rocks Trad Redux Torontonian Sonnie Trotter recently tested his personal limits on the run out Smith Rock classic East Face c d FA Alan Watts The route follows a m crack line and has five bolts a belay station and one fixed piton for protection According to the Smith guide book the route still awaited its first true redpoint almost years after the first ascent Trotter stoked on trad climbs as of late intended to clean the route without clipping any fixed gear Because the route has meagre protection and requires a mandatory runout section at the crux it s rarely attempted My first attempt on lead I took a sweet footer described Trotter It was awesome but a heartbreaker I had only two more moves to go I found it very difficult to place protection while right in the middle of the cruxy bulging sections It took Trotter seven days over two weeks before he put the sequence together In mid April he sent the route It was positively one of my most rewarding climbing moments It was for sure a huge step above You Must Be High in Eldo Referring to a c d R X route he recently climbed Discussing his rev ed fervour for trad climbing Totter claimed that he looks forward to trying other desperately hard climbs on clean gear It just feels right to do things this way Festiglace The North Face du Qu eacute bec On February th to nd the seventh annual Festiglace The North Face du Qu eacute bec was held in Pont Rouge The ice climbing took place in the Ile de Raisin Canyon a spot considered by many to be among the top five ice destinations in the world The competition featured top climbers Guy Lacelle Will Gadd and Abby Watkins in the team speed and mixed events This year s Festiglace drew an excellent turnout from both competitors and spectators Evening entertainment included slide shows by Gadd Sean Isaac and J eacute r ocirc me Blanc Gras The Adidas amateur speed climbing event was a spectator favourite featuring top rock climbers like Nick Sagar trying their hand in this icy medium Gadd St eacute phane Lapointe and J eacute r ocirc me Blancgras were the top three respectively in the men s speed competition while Abby Watkins Audrey Gari eacute py and Myriam St Louis finished one two three in the women s event _Chris Lepik Rockies Mixed Euro Onslaught With the cancellation of this winter s Ice World Cup many of Europe s top mixed climbers made the journey across the Atlantic to attend the Canmore Ice Climbing Festival and Kayland Cup Competition as well as s le the Canadian Rockies renowned mixed testpieces As one local sarcastically pointed out The Cineplex was the Ice World Cup this year The main action was centred on Ben Firth s latest creation The Game M now heralded as the toughest in the world First on the scene was Harry Berger Austria who made a semi repeat of The Game by doing the first roof crux then unknowingly finished up on the last half of the parallel Rocky Mountain Horror Show M instead of its proper finish which is slightly harder Israel Blanco Spain made the true second ascent He overcame the crux dyno with cunning by leaving his heel spur hooked on the tool he launched from in order to make the span He then proceeded to release his lower tool with his feet and bring it up to his hand while dangling by one tool Mauro Bubu Bole Italy made the third ascent but being much shorter than the giant Firth he had to add cm extensions to his axes to make the crux reach Regarding these tactics Firth quips It s all part of the game Evgeny Kirovshetsev Ukraine went on to make a fourth repeat Mixed climbing is evolving at such a breakneck pace that routes like Musashi originally M and only a year ago considered the hardest in the world saw stacks of ascents This m horizontal challenge saw over repeats including its first flash by Blanco and first female ascent by Anna Toretta Italy Other European uber climbers also made rapid repeats including Kurt Astner Italy Herbert Bole Kirovshetsev Chris Cubbet England Ines Papert Germany and Scott Muir Scotland Rocky Mountain Horror Show originally M beside Musashi also saw a flurry of traffic The crux slot has widened creating a very technical torque and making it substantially harder than when originally climbed It saw redpoints by Kirovshetsev and Roger Strong of the USA as well as an onsight ascent by Bole becoming the hardest onsight of a mixed route to date On the local front Sean Isaac of Canmore sent both Rocky Mountain Horror Show and Musashi Along with Isaac Kirovshetsev and Bole are the only other two people this year to repeat both All three believe that RHMS is definitely the harder of the two Musashi has gotten easier with traffic the holds are more positive from picks digging in while RMHS has become harder Having repeated these two testpieces Isaac believes that his and Dave Thomson s Stanley Headwall route Phyllis Diller originally graded M and unrepeated is in retrospect much harder and probably closer to M when compared to the Cineplex routes In the Hoar House Cave at the back of Haffner Creek Joe Buszowski established Neolithic M besides Isaac s roof and log contrivance Caveman M Like its neighbour Neolithic has absolutely no ice but makes up for this with difficulty Berger made the second ascent in four tries confirming the grade Now in his mid s Buszowski is in his mixed climbing prime He has witnessed the evolution of the sport since his first ascent of the classic Mixed Master with Troy Kirwan in Caveman also received its first flash ascent by Calgary strongman Mike Charbonneau Besides the hard sends by visiting climbers local activists have been hard at work establishing more mixed classics The second edition of Mixed Climbs in the Canadian Rockies came out in January and there are already over new routes many of which are of the traditionally protected variety _Sean Isaac North Face of The North Twin Climbed Again Steve House and Marko Prezelj recently made the coveted third ascent up the north face of The North Twin Their mixed route sits between the two now infamous routes on the Twin the unrepeated Lowe Jones and Blanchard Cheesmond routes The ascent is the third time in years the North Twin has been climbed successfully In spite of a minor catastrophe during their third bivy in which House managed to drop his outer right boot the twosome worked their way up the m headwall House was forced to second with a single boot but managed to attach his right cr on to his inner liner Prezelj led the final pitches before the duo were forced to bivi just shy of the summit on April th _Mark Cohen Drytoolers Blitz Rockies Alpine Between February Ben Firth and Raphael Slawinski made the first winter ascent of the Greenwood Locke route on the north face of Mt Temple V A in the summer m M in the winter On day one the duo skied in soloed up the Dolphin couloir then climbed five rope lengths on the headwall before pitching their Bibler over a snow flute Firth and Slawinski freed the remaining six pitches of drytooling on day two According to Slawinski the route had seen previous winter attempts none of them successful Sean Dougherty Jeff Marshall Chris Geisler and the late Guy Edwards all attempted the route Dougherty himself put in four separate attempts As for our climb said Slawinski the difference between it and the previous attempts and perhaps also what tipped the scales in our favour was our extensive drytooling experience both on bolted mixed climbs and on more traditional routes We drytooled the difficult section of the route for no other reason than it was the easiest and fastest way to go about things A month later Slawinski returned to Temple with Russian Valery Babinov who recently immigrated to Canada to climb The Sphinx Face V A a route first done in by Ward Robinson and Rob Orvig Slawinski and Babinov climbed the route and drytooled their way through the route s difficult M sections Unfortunately they were forced to descend shy of the summit because of deteriorating conditions The Greenwood Locke route first climbed in is considered a Rockies alpine classic The route offers the least hazardous most technical climbing on the north face of Temple It sits to the right of the easier but slightly more committing Elzinga Miller summer route that s seen a minimum of three winter ascents _Mark Cohen return to top Got News Did you redpoint your first or finally nail that V We are looking for your news cause lets face it not all of us can climb Well don t
