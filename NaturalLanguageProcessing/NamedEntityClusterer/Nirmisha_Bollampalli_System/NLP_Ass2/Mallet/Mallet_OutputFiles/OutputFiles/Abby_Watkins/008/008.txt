the age of with V boulder problems crack and sport routes and A nail ups to his credit He has been climbing for years and makes his home in Canada s granite destination Squamish BC When asked about his new route on Baffin Island Maddaloni says Our route in Baffin was BIG I m talking about to hour leads of hard and scary aid while living on the wall for days in a row That s enough time for the world to completely cease to exist You eat breathe and sleep climbing something I ve never seemed to attain even from a week long El Capitan route In Maddaloni soloed a foot tower in Pakistan I had never been to a third world country the Himalayas or soloed a big wall first ascent Pakistan seemed the perfect place to satisfy these curiosities Alone and exposed on a granite wall out in the Karakoram mountains left me looking deep into my psyche What I found was alarming and intense and I wanted more In the summer of Maddaloni had finished two new long routes The Black Dyke with pitches and it s crux at b had become Squamish s first all bolt protected multi pitch to the summit of the Chief His Warriors of the Wasteland with pitches was climbed completely ground up and included a meter a finger crack and a c sport pitch all bolted while on lead In commenting on these two very different styles of climbs Maddaloni says I m interested in all adventures and first ascents are guaranteed adventures because what lies ahead is all but a mystery To me this sounds like the most fun Matt s VIMFF multimedia presentation Squamish Long Free Routes will cover his recent breakthrough

milestones of The Thimble and Midnight Lightning to developing the V V is for Verm bouldering grade designing the first commercially available crash pad The Kinnaloa Sketchpad to being a writer for Climbing Magazine John continues to push the envelope of high ball bouldering and society norms He has climbed in every state written profusely on everything from desert sandstone to bagging carpet strips at the base of boulders to the sexual dysfuction of climbing magazine editors He has also written three books Stone Crusade the Bible on the history and development of bouldering in America Sherman Exposed a slightly censored collection of his best and funniest stories and unfortunately prostituted himself with the self help book Better Bouldering for dorks who don t know better Verm is one of the bravest no holds barred funniest pull no punches journos that the climbing community has ever experienced He is a rare breed fat extremely good looking for a sheep shagger he can boulder quite well hates Christian Griffiths with Russ Walling and Dick Cilley and is a self promotor extraordinaire But at all times he must be treated with kid gloves His ego his joints and his tendons are fragile Verm on a boulderer getting old You don t worry so much about getting fat Especially when you find out that chicks half your age dig having something to grab on to The bummer is all the injuries coming back to haunt you Being an old boulderer is very painful However I don t plan to panic until my joints get stiffer than my johnson Verm on his favourite climbing model Laetitia Casta now there is finally something superb coming out of France I say the French invented pulling on gear and calling it freeclimbing I ll admit they played around on the boulders at Fontainebleau and guys like Pierre Allain did some cool stuff but I still credit John Gill with inventing modern bouldering He was the first to pursue bouldering as a gymnastic pursuit and to view the boulders as gymnastic apparatus He was also the first to actively seek out problems which could only be climbed dynamically On Sherman Exposed Outrageous talented and a force to be reckoned with John Sherman is always willing to spout an opinion that s sure to raise eyebrows This rowdy collection of biting satire parody profiles barely restrained rants and genuine reflections on climbing s unsung heroes is no different Blending his juiciest Verm s World columns from Climbing magazine with previously unpublished or perhaps unpublishable stories Sherman pulls no punches even on himself From his college exploits in buildering on the Berkeley c us to his quest for the Fab to his years as a nomadic boulderer Sherman shares the best and the worst he has found in the people and places he encountered

preposterous quest to climb in all states en route experiencing the best and worst climbing the US has to offer It s about an hour long and follows Verm s quest to be first to rock climb in all states of the US Hence it explores the best and worst climbing America has to offer from the big walls of Yosemite to the sw s of Florida It s fairly tongue in cheek as such a quest is pretty ridiculous in the first place but it does make for lots of good stories and proves that if you want climb bad enough you ll find something to scale Also on the same evening a program on recent bouldering

achievements first ascent on Everest in the winter with Leszek Cichy actually a first winter ascent of an thousander first ascent of a m peak in one day Broad Peak hours up and hours down solo a few new routes on the highest peaks many of them climbed solo first winter ascents of the highest peaks Everest Kangchenjunga and Lhotse Wielicki together with the famous Polish expedition leader Andrzej Zawada originated the idea of climbing in the Himalayas in the winter He also climbed the obligatory and so well medialized all fourteen thousanders as well as the highest peaks of each continent but then you in a way expect something like that from a stubborn Pole a proud member of the Art of Suffering movement Wielicki s list of climbing credentials with his meter peak notes may actually appear longer and to an outside observer more boring and drier than Adam Szienkiewicz s oeuvres all combined however a closer insight reveals a very passionate interesting personality Wielicki s Bildung in the Art of Suffering started at the early age During his first climbing season he crashed down and broke three of his lumbar vertebras At the clinic they stuffed him into a plaster corset up to his neck The only problem was his brother was getting married and their mother simply couldn t know that he was climbing at all not to mention the hospital his injury corset and all For his brother s wedding he had to be there and so he cut the plaster with a knife edge and escaped from the hospital through the balcony and roof His friends had brought him clothes and nobody discovered anything Many accidents followed but the will to climb was stronger Those climbing survival stories Wielicki s name is associated above all with the first winter ascent of Everest yet Wielicki got to the expedition from a reserve list For Andrzej Zawada the head of the expedition he was but a greenhorn he was only years old and this was his first major expedition to the high ranges The history of this expedition is fairly well known in short Wielicki reached the summit with Leszek Cichy Interestingly one could say that Wielicki started his Himalayan career from the rear end from the highest mountain in the most extreme conditions He was a member of Solidarnosc the Polish underground party escaping the officials destroying and hiding secret documents and being interrogated by the state police He went to Alaska and earned some decent money by working hard as a fish gutter That was his first contact with capitalism a really dreadful experience since it was the first time he had experienced fierce competition at the workplace Then there came a period of working at heights when there were two doctors and one assistant professor hanging on one chimney Wielicki painted almost the whole of his native Silesia To this day he shows his children where their daddy painted the Katowice steelworks mines buildings conveyor belts chimneys of heat generating plants water towers from Trzebnia to Zabrze Perhaps harder than climbing Everest in the winter capitalism and fighting with the state police was Wielicki s solo Nanga Parbat climb in After climbing K in the summer of he went on to solo Nanga Parbat directly afterwards He was all alone just him and the mountain This was when I was the most scared ever In the most recent years Wielicki was pushing for the first winter ascent of K making two notable attempts in and with a strong international team getting always quite high but never to the top In the vein of the great Polish romantic writers Wielicki secretly dreams about Polish climbers being the first people on all the world s highest peaks in the winter time Wielicki is a Renaissance man of the mountains any mountain any style solo or with friends any season home made cr ons or top gear you name it and Krzysztof can do it If he doesn t make it the first time you bet he be seen there one year later A man of amazing human strength both physical and mental Never stop climbing is his motto pushing on even when it hurts but also knowing when it is time to turn around I will never stop climbing because we should always try to make new and different goals this is the key for mountaineering Wielicki s VIMFF presentation will cover his life time journey of a world class alpine climber and mountaineer as well as many hair raising stories from his climbs
