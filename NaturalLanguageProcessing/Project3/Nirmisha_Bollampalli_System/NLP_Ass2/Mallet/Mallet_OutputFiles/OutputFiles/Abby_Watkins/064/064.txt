Nose in a Day NiaD for the first time Long led mostly free to the top of Boot Flake Westbay did the mixed middle section to C and Bridwell nailed to the summit Their time was about hours In ten years after the Bridwell Long Westbay ascent the NiaD had seen only about repeats In Steve Shipoopi Schneider solos the Nose in In Merry Braun becomes the first woman to climb the NiaD she climbed with her husband Werner Braun The existing NiaD record is which is first lowered to by Florine and Schneider and then shattered by Peter Croft and Dave Schultz with their ascent They climb most of the route in the dark to avoid passing parties Also Don Snyder does the NiaD three times in one season In Hans Florine and Andy Puhvel set the mark at edging out a slightly improved Croft Schultz time of over last year s record Croft and Schultz replied with another record shattering ascent this time in daylight of In Croft teams up with Hans Florine to set the current record The first all female ascent of the NiaD is done in just under hours by Sue McDevitt and Nancy Feagin on the same day Croft later soloed the Steck Salathe in the same day as a warm down In Florine sets the record for soloing the NiaD an amazing As a warm up Lynn Hill climbs the Nose with Florine in about hours the female record Hill later frees the Nose as well In Hill does the NiaD the hard way she freeclimbed every pitch In basically nothing happened In Abby Watkins and Vera Wong set the current all women s Nose record at In Galen Rowell becomes the oldest man to climb the NiaD the year old acclaimed photographer sent

ve climbed the hour Nose route to the top of El Capitan in hours and minutes I can make THIS work What the In Hans Florine and Nancy Feagin climb the Nose and Reg Route on Half Dome in Feagin becomes the first woman to repeat this classic Bachar Croft enchainment The pair climbed the Nose in missing the female record held by Hill and climbed Half Dome in In Hans Florine does the NiaD for the th time Also Herson and Harrell become the only other pair to link the Salathe and the Nose in a push hrs Dean Potter lowers the NiaD solo record to In Hans Florine and Tommy Caldwell showed that the NiaD record of was not out of reach they clocked the second fastest time ever at A couple of weeks later Dean Potter and Timmy O Neill set the new mark at Two weeks later Hans Florine answered back with partner Jim Herson to lower the record by a little more than minutes clocking in at Not to be discouraged Potter and O Neill went back up five days later and set the current record I m sure Florine would have answered back had Winter not arrived soon thereafter In Hans Florine and Yuji Hirayama sliced another minutes off the current record to set the new current mark My prediction is that this record will stand for a long time Timmy O Neill thinks it could go much faster if a few cardio monsters did a lap but the combination of world class aerobic fitness and the ability to climb with big run outs is something we re not likely to see in the near future Enchainments The NiaD is often done by super climbers in conjunction with other routes The first and most famous of these is the John Bachar and Peter Croft climb of the Nose followed by the Reg Route on Half Dome in the same day They put up a time of hours for the Nose and then amazingly passed parties climbed through the rain and set the Half Dome record in just over hours which lasted until In Dean Potter soloed the Nose and Half Dome in the same day Two days later Hans Florine did this as well El Cap was first climbed twice in the same day in when Croft and Schultz climbed the Nose and the Salathe in a total time of hours El Cap was first climbed three times in one day in by Florine and Schneider the pair climbed the Nose the West Face and Lurking Fear using fixed ropes for descent and pre caching water In Dean Potter soloed the Nose then Half Dome in the same day A few days later Hans Florine repeated this feat in doing the routes in the reverse order starting the watch at the base of Half Dome and stopping at the top of El Cap Perhaps one of the most amazing enchainments is Potter and O Neill s link up of Half Dome s Regular Route the South Face of Watkins and the Nose in under hours The pair started Half Dome at am Watkins at pm and the Nose around midnight hard core
