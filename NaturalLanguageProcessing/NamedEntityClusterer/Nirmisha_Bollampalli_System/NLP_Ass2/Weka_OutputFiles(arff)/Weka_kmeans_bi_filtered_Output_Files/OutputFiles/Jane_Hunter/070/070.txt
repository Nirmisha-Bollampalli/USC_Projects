another article under William John Hunter s file though it is written about John s son William John Hunter it gives much about his parents From the book Cyclopaedia of Canadian Biography being chiefly

Rose Pub Co Hunter Rev William John DD John s son pastor of the Wesley Church Hamilton and Superintendant of the Hamilton district was born on the th February at Phillipsburgh in the Province of Quebec He is a son of John and Nancy Hunter who were descended from the Scottish Covenanters but born in the county Tyrone in the North of Ireland They came to Canada in and settled in the Province of

the Christian Ministry namely the subject of this sketch the Rev S J Hunter pastor of the Centenary Methodist Church Hamilton and the Rev H D Hunter M A pastor of the First Congregational Church London Ontario William John Hunter received a good public school education and afterwards attended Victoria University Cobourg pursuing a course in classics and metaphysics and he obtained the degree of Doctor of Divinity from the Chicago University in June Our subject has not confined his attention entirely to church work but has been zealous in the promotion of temperance which may be regarded as a sister employment Whenever the opportunity has arisen to use his voice in forwarding this great cause he has not remained silent He is at present a member of the Royal Templars of Temperance With respect to his religious convictions it need hardly be said that he has always been thoroughly satisfied with the doctrines of Methodism and is a most able broad minded advocate of the name He married on the th July Mary Jane second daughter of Isaac Robinson of Toronto Dr Hunter entered the ministry of the Methodist Church in June and during the past twenty one years he has been in charge of some of the most important churches in London Hamilton Toronto and Ottawa The Dominion Church at Ottawa was built under his direction and is one of the finest ecclesiastical edifices in Canada He was chairman of the Ottawa district for three years and secretary of the Montreal conference He is at present pastor of the Wesley Church Hamilton and superintendant of the Hamilton District It is only justice to say that Dr Hunter is one of the ablest and popular ministers in the Methodist communion of this province There remains a possibility that per son Hamilton s biography which you will see listed under him that John and family may have spent the years from time of arrival in Canada given in the above biography till in the Bytown area John shows up first in the Noyan Census then as shown below in the St Armand Census We should not discount this completely till a thorough search has been made in Methodist and Presbyterian records in the Bytown area Son Robert B s baptism may show up
