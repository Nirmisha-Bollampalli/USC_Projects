indieville review aidan baker thomas baker alan bloor terza rima steering clear of the mainstream since november review info opinion Aidan Baker Thomas Baker Alan Bloor Terza Rima CDR Public Eyesore Genres ambient experimental improv Bryan Day PE S th St Omaha NE Jun Jul The Terza Rima CDR is a recording of a live performance from the Ambient Ping Series which took place in my very hometown of Toronto Canada It is divided into three pieces none of which are shorter than seventeen minutes The first piece is the eerie Pentrametrical which takes a glitchy metallic sound and lays a dark ambiance over it When the sparse piano gradually comes in the resulting noise is slightly more tuneful yet still creepy and spaced out Eventually it turns into a mysterious almost psychedelic sound sculpture that feels as if it could be the score to a very offbeat film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas came to mind The second track is Interlaced Rhyme Scheme a thirty minute epic that spans through ambiance s ling and almost jazzy piano playing It s an amazing accomplished piece that s both bizarre and mesmerizing The final piece is Tertiary which starts off with frantic piano doodling but then dissolves into ambient guitar abstraction only to disintegrate further into a throbbing electronic piano tinkling finale that slowly fades into silence followed by the restrained clapping of a disembodied audience Genius Altogether this is a terrific release of experimental improv and ambient avant garde music Those interested in the genres are encouraged to give Terza Rima a try they won t be disappointed Matt Shimmer Vitals tracks distributed by the label released
