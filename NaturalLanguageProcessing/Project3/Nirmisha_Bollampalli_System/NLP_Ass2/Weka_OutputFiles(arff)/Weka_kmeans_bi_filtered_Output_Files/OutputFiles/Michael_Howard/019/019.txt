November October August July June May April March February January A New Book The Security Development Lifecycle Microsoft Press Much to my wife s chagrin but to my delight I have just completed another book this time with my boss Steve Lipner It s a bit of a departure for me as my prior books have been totally developer centric But that doesn t mean I m any less excited to do it in fact I think this book is more important than Writing Secure Code This time the book documents the Security Development Lifecycle SDL a process that we ve made part of the software development process here at Microsoft to build more secure software Many customers press analysts and to be honest competitors want to know more about what we re doing in the software engineering space to shore up our software s defenses And thanks to the SDL we ve seen good progress to date read in the range of reduction in vulnerabilities sometimes more In my opinion what sets this book apart is the fact that it s based on real world software engineering not theory and is written by two guys whose job it is to work every day with software engineers and management to help them ship more secure software We know what works and we know what doesn t work In fact many people ask me If you had to choose two things from the SDL what would they be and my answer is always the same Everything because if it doesn t work it s wouldn t be in SDL The Table of Contents for the book is Part I The Need for the SDL Chapter Enough Is Enough The Threats Have Changed Chapter Current Software Development Methods Fail to Produce Secure Software Chapter A Short History of the SDL at Microsoft Chapter SDL for Management Part II The Security Development Lifecycle Process Chapter Stage Education and Awareness Chapter Stage Project Inception Chapter Stage Define and Follow Design Best Practices Chapter Stage Product Risk Assessment Chapter Stage Risk Analysis Chapter Stage Creating Security Documents Tools and Best Practices for Customers Chapter Stage Secure Coding Policies Chapter Stage Secure Testing Policies Chapter Stage The Security Push Chapter Stage The Final Security Review Chapter Stage Security Response Planning Chapter Stage Product Release Chapter Stage Security Response Execution Part III SDL Reference Material Chapter Integrating SDL with Agile Methods Chapter SDL Banned Function Calls Chapter SDL Minimum Cryptographic Standards Chapter SDL Required Tools and Compiler Options Chapter Threat Tree Patterns We kept the book short pages to focus on the core elements of the SDL rather than blathering on All the chapters are useful but I think the most interesting chapters are these Ch Really spells out the need for security and it has nothing to do with security Ch Steve did a wonderful job of outlining the history of the SDL at Microsoft It s a real eye opener and a very candid look into the security issues we and the industry face Ch What managers need to know about implementing SDL in terms of benefit and cost Ch This is a highly updated and streamlined and more pragmatic look at our threat modeling and risk analysis framework and it includes a real world fully worked ex le Ch This chapter introduces many security testing techniques including fuzz testing and the book includes the source code for a file fuzzer Ch Another Steve chapter this is an expos of the Microsoft security response process Again it s very candid outlining many of the lessons we have learned building the best response process Ch There has been zero security guidance for Agile methods until now This chapter was written in conjunction with the MSN and Windows Live team Ch When we started threat modeling we asked development teams to build threat trees It turns out that unless you know what you re doing you will never build good threat trees Then we realized that there are threat tree patterns that apply to the various threat types This chapter outlines all the threat trees and how you can use them to design and test your application The book includes a CD that includes a six part video presentation of the Security Basics class we deliver to all new employees here Steve and I are really excited about this book in part because today is the day we sign off on it The galleys are all reviewed and the cover looks great But we re mostly excited because we believe this in an important book the first book to document REAL software development process improvements that yield more secure software It ain t perfect and that s why we update the SDL twice a year but it s a great start The book will be available in June this year You can find more info here http www microsoft com MSPress books asp Posted Friday April PM by michael_HOWARD Filed under Security Comments Think
