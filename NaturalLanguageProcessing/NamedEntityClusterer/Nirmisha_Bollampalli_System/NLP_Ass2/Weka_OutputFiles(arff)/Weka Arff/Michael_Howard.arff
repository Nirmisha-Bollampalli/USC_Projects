Contents Early life Career in Government Infamous interview on Newsnight First attempt to become Conservative leader Something of the night about him claims Widdecombe Conservative Leader Crossing swords with Paxman again Election Criticism of c aign Cash for Peerages Final months as party leader See also References External links edit Early life Howard was born in Gorseinon Wales the son of immigrant Romanian Jewish shopkeeper Bernard Hecht His mother Hilda Kershion was Welsh born and of Eastern European Jewish ancestry When Howard was six the family name Hecht was anglicised to Howard He attended Llanelli Grammar School and Peterhouse Cambridge and was President of the Cambridge Union Society in After taking a in the first part of the Economics tripos he switched to Law and graduated with a in Howard was one of a cluster of bright Conservative students at Cambridge around this time sometimes referred to as the Cambridge Mafia many of whom went on to hold high government office under Margaret Thatcher and John Major See Cambridge University Conservative Association Howard was called to Bar Inner Temple in and specialised in employment law and planning issues The late s saw his promotion within the Bow Group where he became Chairman in At the Conservative Party conference of he made a notable speech commending the government for attempting to curb trade union power Unlike his many Cambridge contemporaries Howard found it difficult to find and be selected for a winnable parliamentary seat and so continued his career at the Bar where he would become a Queen s Counsel in In June of that year Howard was selected for the constituency of Folkestone and Hythe in succession of the retiring the Sir Albert Costain He won his seat in the general election of without difficulty Howard had previously twice fought and lost the safe Labour seat of Liverpool Edge Hill in and these early races led to his support for Liverpool F C In the s Howard was a leading advocate of British membership of the Common Market EEC and served on the board of the cross party Britain in Europe group Howard was named as co respondent in the high profile divorce case of s model Sandra Paul She and Howard subsequently married in her fourth marriage their son Nicholas was born in and daughter Larissa in edit Career in Government Howard very quickly rose in the ranks of Government becoming Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry in with responsibility for regulating the financial dealings of the City of London This junior post became very important as he oversaw the Big Bang introduction of new technology in After the election he became Minister for Local Government On behalf of the Government he accepted the amendment which would become Section and defended its inclusion Howard then guided through the House of Commons the Local Government Finance Act This act brought in Margaret Thatcher s new system of local taxation officially known as the Community Charge but almost universally nicknamed the poll tax Howard personally supported the tax and won the respect of Mrs Thatcher for minimising the rebellion against it within the Conservative Party After a period as Minister for Water and Planning in during which he was responsible for implementing water privatization in England and Wales Howard was promoted to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Employment in January with the resignation of Norman Fowler Howard subsequently guided through legislation abolishing the closed shop and c aigned vigorously for Mrs Thatcher in the first ballot of the leadership contest in November He retained his cabinet post under John Major and c aigned against trade union power during the general election c aign His work in the c aign led to his appointment as Secretary of State for the Environment in the reshuffle after the election In this capacity he encouraged the United States to participate in the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro but he was soon after appointed Home Secretary in a reshuffle initiated by the sacking of Norman Lamont His tenure as Home Secretary was especially notable for his tough approach to crime which he summed up in the sound bite prison works Howard repeatedly clashed with judges and prison reformers as he sought to cl down on crime through a series of tough measures Under his tenure recorded crime fell for the first time in over years by a record a feat achieved neither before or since edit Infamous interview on Newsnight His reputation was dented on May when a critical inquiry into a series of prison escapes was published In advance of the publication Howard made statements to assign blame to the prison service A further controversy came when a television interviewer Jeremy Paxman relentlessly asked him the same question times in all and not the widely believed times during an edition of the Newsnight programme Asking whether Howard had intervened when Derek Lewis sacked a prison governor Paxman asked Did you threaten to overrule him Howard did not give a direct answer instead repeatedly saying that he did not overrule him and ignoring the threaten part of the question The BBC subsequently revealed that the repetition of the question was in fact a filler to extend the interview as the next segment of Newsnight was not ready for broadcast The interview remains one of the most infamous in broadcasting history In the longer term its precise impact on Howard s reputation remains disputed Some suggest that it highlighted his arrogant refusal to answer the question others suggest that it highlighted his resilience and refusal to be bullied even by one of Britain s toughest interviewers However in the same interview an incredulous Paxman also asked him do you seriously expect to be leader of your party In a November interview see below Paxman returned to his question from Mr Howard was surprised remarking Come on Jeremy are you really going back over that again As it happens I didn t Are you satisfied now This was confirmed in when under the Freedom of Information Act the Conservative Party obtained documents proving that Howard did not threaten to overrule Derek Lewis citation needed edit First attempt to become Conservative leader After the resignation of John Major Howard and William Hague announced they would be running on the same ticket with Howard as leader and Hague as Deputy Leader and Party Chairman However the day after they agreed this Hague decided to run on his own Howard also stood but his c aign was marred by attacks on his record as Home Secretary Howard came in last out of five candidates with the support of only twenty three MPs in the first round of polling for the leadership election He then withdrew from the race and endorsed the eventual winner William Hague Howard served as Shadow Foreign Secretary for the next two years but would retire from the Shadow Cabinet in though remaining an MP edit Something of the night about him claims Widdecombe Six days after the Derek Lewis incident on Newsnight Ann Widdecombe his former minister of state in the Home Office made a statement in the House of Commons about the dismissal of then director of the Prison Service Derek Lewis and famously remarked of Howard that there is something of the night about him a widely ed comment that fatally damaged his bid for the Conservative Party leadership The comment was taken as a reference to his dour demeanor which she implied was sinister and almost Dracula like and related to his Romanian ancestry Melanie Phillips felt there was a hint of anti semitism about the remark edit Conservative Leader After the General Election Howard was recalled to frontline politics when the Conservatives new leader Iain Duncan Smith appointed him Shadow Chancellor His performances in the post won him much praise indeed under his guidance the Conservatives decided to debate the economy on an Opposition Day for the first time in several years After Duncan Smith was removed from the leadership Howard was elected unopposed as leader of the party in November As leader he faced much less discontent within the party than any of his three predecessors and was seen as a steady hand He avoided repeating such managerial missteps as Duncan Smith s firing of David Davis as Conservative Party Chairman and imposed discipline quickly and firmly he removed the party whip from Ann Winterton following her telling of a racial joke His performances against Tony Blair at the despatch box were more effective than those of his predecessor as leader He was perhaps helped in all this by the Conservative Party s exhaustion after thirteen years of party turmoil following Margaret Thatcher s overthrow years which had left the party more willing to unite and rally round a leader In February Howard called on PM Tony Blair to resign over the Iraq war for failing to ask basic questions regarding WMD claims and misleading Parliament In July the Conservative leader stated that he would not have voted for the motion that authorised the Iraq war had he known the quality of intelligence information on which the WMD claims were based At the same time he said he still believed in the Iraq invasion was right because the prize of a stable Iraq was worth striving for His criticism of Blair did not earn Howard sympathies in Washington DC where President Bush refused to meet him Karl Rove is reported to have told Howard you can forget about meeting the president Don t bother coming Michael Howard was named Parliamentarian of the Year by The Spectator and Zurich UK This was in recognition of his performance at the despatch box in his previous role as Shadow Chancellor edit Crossing swords with Paxman again In November Newsnight again concentrated on Howard with coverage of a c aign trip to Cornwall and an interview with Jeremy Paxman The piece which purported to show that members of the public were unable to identify Howard and that those who recognized him did not support him was the subject of an official complaint from the Conservative Party The complaint claimed that the Newsnight team only spoke to people who held opinions against either Michael Howard or the Conservatives and that Paxman s style was bullying and unnecessarily aggressive edit Election In the May general election Michael Howard s party failed to unseat the Labour Government although the Conservatives did gain seats five from the Liberal Democrats and Labour s majority shrank from to The Conservative share of the national vote increased by from and from Commentators pointed to the state of Britain s constituency boundaries coupled with the first past the post British voting system which together heavily discriminate in favour of the ruling Labour Party It is estimated that changes proposed by the Boundary Commission for England would result in a gain of seats for the Conservatives with no change in the vote citation needed Despite the third consecutive loss Howard received much praise for the election results which bought forward strong elections policy on crime immigration and tax freedom day The day after the election Howard stated in a speech in the newly gained Conservative seat in Putney that he would not lead the party into the next General Election as he would be too old and that he would stand down sooner rather than later following a revision of the Conservative leadership electoral process Despite the election of a third consecutive Labour government Howard described the election as the beginning of a recovery for the Conservative party after Labour s landslide victories in and Howard s own constituency of Folkestone and Hythe had been heavily targeted by the Liberal Democrats as the most sought after prize of their failed decapitation strategy of seeking to gain seats from prominent Conservatives Yet Howard almost doubled his majority to whilst the Liberal Democrats saw their vote fall edit Criticism of c aign During the c aign Howard was criticised by some commentators for conducting a c aign which addressed the issues of immigration asylum seekers and travellers when he himself was the descendant of immigrants Others point out that the continued media coverage of such issues created most of the controversy and that Howard merely defended his views when questioned at unrelated policy launches Some evidence suggested that the public generally supported policies proposed by the Conservative Party when they were not told which party had proposed them indicating that the party still had an image problem Conservative John Major s lead in amongst the sought after ABC voters e g doctors lawyers students managers had all but disappeared by The c aign focus on immigration may have been influenced by Howard s election adviser Lynton Crosby who earlier had run similar tactics in Australian elections Whether the hiring of Crosby was a good idea or not in hindsight his organisation of the c aign was credited with making the Conservative election drive much more professional and organised than at the previous election During the c aign Howard continued to impose strong party discipline controversially forcing the deselection of Danny Kruger Sedgefield Adrian Hilton Slough and Howard Flight Arundel South Downs edit Cash for Peerages On October Michael Howard revealed that he had voluntarily been questioned as a potential witness concerning the Cash for Peerages investigation surrounding fundraising and the election c aign He is not suspected of any criminal activity edit Final months as party leader Despite announcing after the General Election that he would vacate the role of party leader Howard performed a substantial reshuffle of the party s front bench on the th May in which several rising star MPs were given their first shadow portfolios including George Osborne and David Cameron This move cleared the way for David Cameron who had worked for Howard as Policy Advisor when the latter was Home Secretary to run for the Conservative Party leadership The reforms to the party s election process took a number of months and Howard held power as leader for six months of the new parliament During that period he enjoyed a fairly pressure free time often making joking comparisons between himself and Tony Blair both of whom had declared they would not stand at the next General Election He also oversaw Blair s first parliamentary defeat when the Conservative Party the Liberal Democrats and sufficient Labour Party rebels voted against government proposals to extend to days the period that terror suspects could be held for without charge Howard stood down as leader in December of and was replaced by David Cameron Howard announced on th March that he will be standing down as MP for Folkestone and Hythe at the next election expected to be held in or edit See also Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet UK

Howdy once again from RSA It s raining So much for sunny California Jeff and I just gave our talk about Windows Vista Security Engineering It was a packed room In fact when we got to the room we saw a bunch of people milling around outside We went to the door to enter and we were told we could not enter because the room was full We thought the previous talk had yet to finish but we were wrong it was filled with people attending our talk We asked if we could enter because we were the speakers and again we were told NO Then Jeff said seriously we re the speakers So they let us in So much for security Anyway back to the topic at hand There is a great deal of FUD about UAC Yeah it was very chatty in beta but we really made a great deal of progress for the final release of Windows Vista In general it s a little chatty at the start but once you settle in install the apps you need and the printer drivers and so on it s pretty quiet But there is a perception that it s still very chatty

look Perception Reality Posted Thursday February PM by michael_HOWARD Comments Filed under Rant Vista Security Something Windows Vista Parental Controls cannot protect against Howdy from RSA in San Francisco I just got here and I have a talk tomorrow morning AM about Windows Vista Security Engineering Now to the topic of this post One of my favorite features in Windows Vista is Parental Controls I like the feature because my year old son Blake loves to use the computer but I really don t want him using the computer too much because he gets that glazed over eyes look You know the look So I limit his use to between PM and PM during the week which basically means he can t use it before school The other day a Saturday he wanted to use the computer and my wife had asked me to lock him out because he d hit his sister or something So I tweaked the Parental Controls policy to block out Saturday He came to me asking if he could use the computer because he couldn t logon I said No because he d hit his kid sister or something I went to go about my own business and came back fifteen minutes later to see that Blake had opened the computer case and with screwdriver in hand was trying to fix things daddy so he could access the computer I didn t know whether to laugh cry or be proud that my son wasn t going to be held back by some stinkin software policy Posted Wednesday February PM by michael_HOWARD Comments Filed under Vista Security What is it that makes security hard I ve been asked this question numerous times often in the guise of a question like why can t you guys simply fix the security problem or reliability and scalability problems are understood and solvable why can t you do the same with security or my favorite variant what the heck keeps you interested in security when it seems you re fighting a no win battle First there is little agreement around what constitutes a security bug so I ll leave that subject for another day Next I m no expert on the science behind reliability or scalability so I ll take it at face value that when people say these issues are understood and solvable and they are being honest So what is it that makes security hard It s simple Scalability and reliability issues are man vs machine and machines are stupid Security is man vs man and humans are intelligent This security stuff is an ongoing arms race and chess game and each side is constantly trying to outwit the other We raise the bar and the attackers then spend time trying to defeat that bar So we raise the bar again and so on With reliability and scalability we can understand the adversary and that s that The enemy won t adapt to defeat you To be honest it s this on going intellectual battle that keeps me coming back to security but it also means that no one will ever build secure computer products and this why we update the Security Development Lifecycle SDL twice a year as we learn new attack and defense techniques Posted Friday February PM by michael_HOWARD Comments Filed under Rant Security Security Features vs Convenience Jim Allchin has a great blog post about some of the design issues we went through and tradeoffs we made in Windows

in the macworld com web site that allowed the blogger to get a Platinum Pass into MacWorld to see the Jobs keynote I m assuming the story is true If it s not it is still a fascinating read about insecure code Posted Saturday January AM by michael_HOWARD Comments Filed under Security Why Windows Vista is unaffected by the VML Bug MS does not affect Windows Vista even though the coding bug is there Why The bug is an integer overflow calling C operator new but the affected component vgx dll is compiled with the C compiler available in Visual Studio that automatically detects integer overflows at runtime All of Windows Vista is compiled with this compiler You can read more about this compiler change in a previous blog The moral of this story is developers will never find all code level security bugs so you need other defenses Just in case Posted Wednesday January PM by michael_HOWARD Comments Filed under Vista Security Windows Live OneCare v is released to manufacturing This is great news OneCare is one of my all time fave products I love it because it was built knowing that the target user is no security expert It wasn t built by geeks for geeks Everyone in my immediate family uses OneCare because to e my year old father in law it s dead easy simple and doesn t keep popping up messages I don t understand I get green and stay green Windows Live OneCare also works on Windows Vista and yes I will install it on my wife s computer More info here Posted Friday January AM by michael_HOWARD Comments Filed under Vista Security My Take on Visual Studio SP and Windows Vista Over the last couple of days many people have asked for my take on the fact that Visual Studio SP requires admin privileges to run on Windows Vista and pops up a dialog saying so when it starts up So here s my take and I don t work for the Developer Division VS SP was developed while Windows Vista was being developed and because of potential late breaking regressions in the OS which can happen the VS team decided to simply do what most service packs do fix bugs that stop people doing their jobs Now that Vista has shipped the VS team is working on an SP that works better as a non admin on Windows Vista and this is goodness Now to the pop up that recommends you run as an admin In my opinion the VS team was simply being very conservative because some scenarios simply do not work well as a non admin For ex le registering a COM control installing or debugging a service or performing admin tasks against SQL Server and so on all require elevated capability as they very well should I probably spend of my time writing and debugging C code of the time using C and doing SQL and I always run as a non admin In fact I ran as non admin for prior versions of Visual Studio on Windows XP of what I do works perfectly well For the of the time I need to do some admin task I run an elevated VS In closing the dialog is a little alarming just do what I did uncheck the option to display the dialog box and get on with life One more thing the VS team has provided a list of known issues with VS on Windows Vista Posted Thursday January PM by michael_HOWARD Comments Filed under Rant Vista Security Visual Studio Service Pack Update for Windows Vista Beta Available From the blurb During the development of Windows Vista several key investments were made to vastly improve overall quality security and reliability from previous versions of Windows While we have made tremendous investments in Windows Vista to ensure backwards compatibility some of the system enhancements such as User Account Control changes to the networking stack and the new graphics model make Windows Vista behave differently from previous versions of Windows These investments impact Visual Studio The Visual Studio Service Pack Update for Windows Vista Beta addresses areas of Visual Studio impacted by Vista enhancements Many of the Windows Vista enhancements are documented at the Windows Vista Development Center The update is here Posted Monday January PM by michael_HOWARD Comments Filed under Vista Security eXPired Poster Available First a very Happy New Year to you all Second due to

All it does is add a new setting to your PE header So grab the update and link your EXE with the new dynamicbase option Voila Posted Saturday December PM by michael_HOWARD Comments Filed under Vista Security Update on Internet Explorer DEP and Adobe Software Because browsers can host plug in extensibility security settings within the browser can make plug ins fail This is why in Internet Explorer Data Execution Prevention DEP is off by default When it is enabled many plug in components fail to run often crashing the browser You can enable DEP by navigating to the following dialog and checking the highlighted option shown below note you must elevated to admin first otherwise the option is grayed out I have some great news however Two of the most well known and commonly used browser plug ins the Adobe Acrobat Reader browser helper object and the Adobe Flash Player now run when DEP is enabled So jump on over to the Adobe site download the latest versions of Flash Player and Acrobat Reader and enable DEP in IE I have A Big Thanks to the folks at Adobe for doing this Posted Tuesday December AM by michael_HOWARD Comments Filed under Security Windows Vista ASLR DEP and OEMs As I mentioned in a previous series of posts we recently had all the major OEMs on c us to discuss SDL and how we can work together My big ask of the OEMs actually I grovelled it was pathetic was to enable DEP NX in the BIOS by default on all their shipping PCs in time for Windows Vista The reason for this ask is pretty simple for ASLR to be effective DEP NX must be enabled by default too Here s the good news I found out yesterday that all the major OEMs you know who they are have agreed to not disable DEP NX in their BIOSs by default This is huge If you re an OEM reading this THANKS Note you can verify if your PC has DEP enabled by following these steps Open the Control Panel Select System Maintenance Click System Click Advanced system Settings Click the Advanced tab Click Performance Settings Click the Data Execution Prevention tab You should see the dialog box below If not check your BIOS and make sure your CPU is capable of DEP NX most CPUs these days support DEP NX Posted Wednesday December

forever Stanislavski s work provoked profound responses in artists around the world who came in contact with his teachings During the s the Group Theatre under the direction of Harold Clurman embraced and wrestled with Stanislavski s work A mixture of genius drive and some cutting edge writing created the most important movement in the history of the American Theatre This hotbed was where Lee

Michael to replace him at the High School of Performing Arts Michael s teaching career began in earnest Soon after a group of his friends who were meeting regularly to practice their craft asked Michael to lead their sessions That was the beginning of The Michael Howard Studios Most important in its development has been Michael s ability to surround himself with other artists of the highest caliber to complete the faculty The Michael Howard Studios has changed forms and locations several times since then And yet Michael s core belief that there cannot be one way to act that all actors must develop their own method has not changed Michael s classes as well as the Studio at large encompass many schools of thought the influence of the great teachers mentioned above as well as techniques developed by great teachers from around the world Hence a lineage began over a hundred years ago continues The pursuit of the work is enriched with tradition as well as bold new ideas Michael s contribution to our heritage is reflected in the countless numbers of actors directors and teachers who have been his students over the past years and counting About Our Logo More than half a century ago the brilliant clown Charlie Chaplin invited the great musician Igor Stravinsky to his home Documented in photographs in Life Magazine Chaplin brought Stravinsky into his back yard and showed him a large circular contraption about seven feet in diameter The wheel was designed in such a way as for a person to be the spokes Stravinsky placed himself inside with arms akimbo and legs spread as Chaplin rolled him around It is clear in the photographs that both of them are laughing having a blast When Michael saw the magazine article he had an artist take the image and incorporate the harlequin figure symbolizing theatrical tradition So more briefly put the logo represents geniuses at play A Method of One s Own Reprinted by permission from the January issue of American Theatre Magazine published by TCG MICHAEL HOWARD Founder Director Michael Howard Studios New York I taught at Juilliard in the drama division for eight years During that period I continued my private class working with actors who had begun their professional careers Clearly the intensive training at Juilliard had great value for all the participants at whatever level But there were also drawbacks to conservatory training Understandably the actor is not allowed to accept professional engagements a difficult restriction for some an impossible restriction for others Further training institutions admit people into the first year when perhaps the individual should have second year work or perhaps at the end of six months the are really ready to move into the second or third year Obviously none of this is possible Then there is the problem of chemistry that very important relationship between student and teachers It is not just a question of what is being taught but how All teachers have seen that look on the face of a student which says Oh god do I have to spend a year with this person It s like an arranged marriage it s daunting In this studio students sign up for one month at a time It s hard to maintain this organizationally even financially but everyone in my class is in the seat because that s where he or she wants to be I think that s important Also these people have limited study time and money It s possible for me to say Listen stop my class concentrate on your voice work and then come back Actors construct their own university program The vast majority of actors who study at this studio have a goodly amount of previous training And the teachers who teach here come from very different backgrounds I think we would all agree that our job is to help them define their own method Young actors today ask me Do you do Meisner or Do you do Strasberg It s all rather faddish When I m asked What is Michael Howard s method I run I say I don t have a method of acting I suppose I have a method of training I think it s a bit slick but I think it s true I work with actors individually to develop their own method In any important performance the actor is in danger the actor is at risk An actor illuminates the material reveals the playwright by revealing some aspect of him or herself often something private In our theatre there s a great deal of talk about use yourself or just be there In fact that s very important It is the bottom line But it raises the essential question Which self The whole rehearsal process is based on discovering which self the playwright wants you to bring to the work I tell the actors the world needs us desperately whether the world recognizes it or not I demand that they prepare themselves to be the best actors they can be A life in the American theatre means to do and do well commercials a great play which no one sees a soap for a few years a lousy movie that everyone sees a great part in a movie that leads to nothing I think it s a splendid way to spend a life If you re lucky if you hang on long enough and if you ready yourself as an artist you will get work There s struggle and pain but I think making a life in the theatre is worth it Acting is easy it s not a desperately complicated process Some children have done it startlingly well brilliantly well in ways that make you gulp The hard part is becoming an artist which means using all of you not just the comfortable part not just the part the child uses easily and quickly not just the part they buy and want again and again It is when you begin to use the dreadful parts the secret parts as well as the hero parts that the word artist begins to have a very special meaning And that takes time It can happen without any help from anybody it cannot happen without work It happens more efficiently with study There are actors Dustin Hoffman is one working in the commercial theatre who insist that the industry let them stretch who insist that they use the clown part of them or the woman part of them They force themselves to go out and find those parts And they become artists Those who keep repeating don t The actors who aren t getting that kind of opportunity in the business and need a place to extend their work are the ones I can help Not teach them how to act but to help them develop grow extend Self Marketing COMING SOON Copyright

Conservative loss in the elections he was succeeded by David Cameron Wikipedia Library gt Reference gt Wikipedia Michael Howard For other persons named Michael Howard see Michael Howard disambiguation The Rt Hon Michael Howard Michael Howard QC born July is a British politician and former Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Conservative Party from November to December Since becoming an MP at the General Election he also held a number of positions in successive Conservative governments until their electoral defeat in most notably Home Secretary under John Major Early life Howard was born in Gorseinon Wales where his Romanian Jewish shopkeeper father Bernard Hecht had moved as an economic migrant His mother Hilda Kershion was Welsh born and of Eastern European Jewish ancestry When Howard was six the family name Hecht was anglicised to Howard he has occasionally been referred to in later life as Michael Hecht or even Michel Hecht usually by far right and anti Semitic people He attended Llanelli Grammar School and Peterhouse Cambridge and was President of the Cambridge Union Society in After taking a in the first part of the Economics tripos he switched to Law and graduated with a in Howard was one of a cluster of bright Conservative students at Cambridge around this time sometimes referred to as the Cambridge Mafia many of whom went on to hold high government office under Margaret Thatcher and John Major See Cambridge University Conservative Association He was called to the Bar Inner Temple in and specialised in employment law and planning issues In the election he fought the safe Labour seat of Liverpool Edge Hill which led to his support for Liverpool F C The late s saw his promotion within the Bow Group where he became Chairman in shortly after the general election in which he was again defeated at Edge Hill At the Conservative Party conference of he made a notable speech commending the government for attempting to curbe trade union power At this time Howard was a leading advocate of British membership of the Common Market EEC and served on the board of the cross party Britain in Europe group Howard was named as co respondent in the high profile divorce case of former s model Sandra Paul She and Howard subsequently married in her fourth marriage their son Nicholas was born in and daughter Larissa in Unlike his many Cambridge contemporaries Howard found it difficult to find and be selected for a winnable parliamentary seat and so continued his career at the Bar where he became a Queen s Counsel in In June Howard was finally selected for the constituency of Folkestone and Hythe in succession of the retiring the Sir Albert Costain He won his seat in the general election of without difficulty Career in Government Howard very quickly rose in the ranks of Government becoming Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry in with responsibility for regulating the financial dealings of the City of London This junior post became very important as he oversaw the Big Bang introduction of new technology in After the election he became Minister for Local Government On behalf of the Government he accepted the amendment which would become Section and defended its inclusion Howard then guided through the House of Commons the Local Government Finance Act This act brought in Margaret Thatcher s new system of local taxation officially known as the Community Charge but almost universally nicknamed the poll tax Howard personally supported the tax and won the respect of Mrs Thatcher for minimising the rebellion against it within the Conservative Party After a period as Minister for Water and Planning in during which he was responsible for implementing water privatization in England and Wales Howard was promoted to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Employment in January with the resignation of Norman Fowler who left to spend more time with his family Howard subsequently guided through legislation abolishing the closed shop and c aigned vigorously for Mrs Thatcher in the first ballot of the leadership contest in November He retained his cabinet post under John Major and c aigned against trade union power during the general election c aign His work in the c aign led to his appointment as Secretary of State for the Environment in the reshuffle after the election In this capacity he encouraged the United States to participate in the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro but he was soon after appointed as Home Secretary in a reshuffle initiated by the sacking of Norman Lamont His tenure as Home Secretary was especially notable for his tough approach to crime which he summed up in the soundbite prison works Howard repeatedly clashed with judges and prison reformers as he sought to cl down on crime through a series of tough measures Under his tenure recorded crime fell for the first time in over years Infamous interview on Newsnight His reputation was dented on May when a critical inquiry into a series of prison escapes was published In advance of the publication Howard made statements to assign blame to the prison service A further controversy came when a television interviewer Jeremy Paxman relentlessly asked him the same question times in all and not the widely believed times during an edition of the Newsnight programme Asking whether Howard had intervened when Derek Lewis sacked a prison governor Paxman asked Did you threaten to overrule him Howard did not give a direct answer instead repeatedly saying that he did not overrule him and ignoring the threaten part of the question The BBC subsequently revealed that the prolonged period where the question was repeated was in fact a filler to extend the interview as technical reasons meant the next segment of that night s Newsnight was not ready for broadcast While some praised the interview for journalistic toughness others including some in the BBC criticised it as a theatrical stunt The interview remains one of the most infamous in broadcasting history In the longer term its precise impact on Howard s reputation remains disputed Some suggest that it highlighted his arrogant refusal to answer the question others suggest that it highlighted his resilience and refusal to be bullied even by one of Britain s toughest interviewers However in the same interview an incredulous Paxman also asked Michael do you seriously expect to be leader of your party In a November interview see below Paxman returned to his question from Mr Howard was surprised remarking Come on Jeremy are you really going back over that again As it happens I didn t Are you satisfied now eh This was confirmed in when under the Freedom of Information Act the Conservative Party obtained documents proving that Howard did not threaten to overrule Derek Lewis citation needed First attempt to become Conservative leader After the resignation of John Major Howard and William Hague announced they would be running on the same ticket with Howard as leader and Hague as Deputy Leader and Party Chairman However the day after they agreed this Hague decided to run on his own Howard also stood but his c aign was marred by attacks on his record as Home Secretary Howard came in last out of five candidates with the support of only twenty three MPs in the first round of polling for the leadership election He then withdrew from the race and endorsed the eventual winner William Hague Howard served as Shadow Foreign Secretary for the next two years but would retire from the Shadow Cabinet in though re remained an MP Something of the night about him claims Widdecombe Six days after the Derek Lewis incident on Newsnight Ann Widdecombe his former minister of state in the Home Office made a statement in the House of Commons about the dismissal of then director of the Prison Service Derek Lewis and famously remarked of Howard that there is something of the night about him a widely ed comment that fatally damaged his bid for the Conservative Party leadership The comment was taken as a reference to his dour demeanour which she implied was sinister and almost Dracula like and related to his Romanian ancestry Melanie Phillips felt there was a hint of anti semitism about the remark Conservative Leader After the General Election Howard was recalled to frontline politics when the Conservatives new leader Iain Duncan Smith appointed him as Shadow Chancellor His performances as Shadow Chancellor won him much praise indeed under his guidance the Conservatives decided to debate the economy on an Opposition Day for the first time since coming to power After Duncan Smith was removed from the leadership Howard was elected unopposed as leader of the party in November As leader he faced much less discontent within the party than any of his three predecessors and was seen as a steady hand He avoided repeating such managerial missteps as Duncan Smith s firing of David Davis as Conservative Party Chairman and imposed discipline quickly and firmly he removed the party whip from Ann Winterton following her telling of a racist joke His performances against Tony Blair at the despatch box were more effective than those of his predecessor as leader He was perhaps helped in all this by the Conservative Party s exhaustion after thirteen years of party turmoil following Margaret Thatcher s overthrow years which had left the party more willing to unite and rally round a leader In February Howard called on PM Tony Blair to resign over the Iraq war for failing to ask basic questions regarding WMD claims and misleading Parliament In July the Conservative leader stated that he would not have voted for the motion that authorised the Iraq war had he known the quality of intelligence information on which the WMD claims were based At the same time he said he still believed in the Iraq invasion was right because the prize of a stable Iraq was worth striving for His criticism of Blair did not earn Howard sympathies in Washington DC where President Bush refused to meet him Karl Rove is reported to have told Howard you can forget about meeting the president Don t bother coming Michael Howard was named Parliamentarian of the Year by The Spectator and Zurich UK This was in recognition of his performance at the despatch box in his previous role as Shadow Chancellor Crossing swords with Paxman In November Newsnight again concentrated on Howard with coverage of a c aign trip to Cornwall and an interview with Jeremy Paxman The piece which purported to show that members of the public were unable to identify Howard and that those who recognized him did not support him was the subject of an official complaint from the Conservative Party The complaint claimed that the Newsnight team only spoke to people who held opinions against either Michael Howard or the Conservatives and that Paxman s style was bullying and unnecessarily aggressive Election In the May general election Michael Howard s party failed to unseat the Labour Government although the Conservatives did gain seats five from the Liberal Democrats and Labour s majority shrank from to The Conservative share of the national vote only ticked up by from and from However because of the first past the post British voting system the seats won in parliament for all parties did not reflect their proportionate overall share of the national vote Commentators pointed to the state of Britain s constituency boundaries that heavily discriminated in favour of the Labour Party It is estimated that changes proposed by the Boundary Commission for England would result in a gain of seats for the Conservatives with no change in the vote The day after the election Howard stated in a speech in the newly gained Conservative seat in Putney that he would not lead the party into the next General Election as he would be too old and that he would stand down sooner rather than later following a revision of the Conservative leadership electoral process Despite the election of a third consecutive Labour government Howard described the election as the beginning of a recovery for the Conservative party after Labour s landslide victories in and Howard s own constituency of Folkestone and Hythe had been heavily targeted by the Liberal Democrats as the most sought after prize of their decapitation strategy of seeking to gain the seats of prominent Conservatives Yet Howard almost doubled his majority to whilst the Liberal Democrats saw their vote fall Criticism of c aign During the c aign Howard was criticised by some commentators for conducting a c aign which addressed the issues of immigration asylum seekers and travellers when he himself was the descendant of immigrants Others point out that the continued media coverage of such issues created most of the controversy and that Howard merely defended his views when questioned at unrelated policy launches Some evidence suggested that the public generally supported policies proposed by the Conservative Party when they were not told which party had proposed them indicating that the party still had an image problem citation needed Many middle class voters found Howard s perceived election c aign emphasis to be disagreeable amongst key ABC voters e g doctors lawyers students managers the party s lead over Labour disappeared compared with a percentage point lead under John Major in The focus on immigration was widely alleged to have been influenced by Howard s election adviser Lynton Crosby who has been alleged to have used similar tactics in Australian elections Whether the hiring of Crosby was a good idea or not in hindsight his organisation of the c aign was credited with making the Conservative election drive much more professional and organised than at the previous election During the c aign Howard continued to impose strong party discipline controversially forcing the deselection of Danny Kruger Sedgefield Adrian Hilton Slough and Howard Flight Arundel South Downs Cash for Peerages On October Michael Howard revealed that he had voluntarily been questioned as a potential witness concerning the Cash for Peerages investigation surrounding fundraising and the election c aign He was not arrested or cautioned and is not suspected of any criminal activity Final months as party leader Despite announcing after the General Election that he would vacate the role of party leader Howard performed a substantial reshuffle of the party s front bench on the th May in which several rising star MPs were given their first shadow portfolios in particular George Osborne and David Cameron This move cleared the way for David Cameron who had worked for Howard as Policy Advisor when Howard was Home Secretary to run for the Conservative Party leadership The reforms to the party s election process took a number of months and Howard held power as leader for six months of the new parliament During that period he enjoyed a fairly pressure free time often making joking comparisons between himself and Tony Blair both of whom had declared they would not stand at the next General Election He also oversaw Blair s first parliamentary defeat when the Conservative Party the Liberal Democrats and sufficient Labour Party rebels voted against government proposals to extend to days

undeclared Labour are on down the Tories on up and the Lib Dems on up Mr Howard said the party s results and c aign meant that it could now hold its head up high Labour s majority is predicted to drop

age meant he could not lead the party into the next general election LATEST RESULTS Enter a full postcode seats needed to win LAB CON LD Text of Mr Howard s speech I m years old At the time of the next election in four or five years time I ll be or and I believe that s simply too old to lead a party into government So as I can t fight the next election as leader of our party I believe its better for me to stand aside sooner rather than later so that the party can choose someone who can I want to avoid the uncertainty of prolonged debate about the leadership of the party I want the next Conservative leader to have much more time than I had to prepare our party for government If we ve achieved this much in just months imagine what we can achieve in the next four or five years I ve said that if people don t deliver then they go and for me delivering meant winning the election Michael Howard Possible future leaders Howard s parting favour Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin was quick to rule himself out of the running saying he had no intention at all of standing There were changes to the process for electing a Tory leader under the stewardship of William Hague and there is already speculation that the role of the party s rank and file could be reduced Shadow minister for deregulation John Redwood refused to say whether he would be standing Mr Redwood a former challenger said it was important any reforms avoiding losing all contact with the membership Ex Conservative Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine urged his party not to rush to a decision about the leadership It will take time it will be a little messy but it will be a great deal better than another quick decision that goes wrong said Lord Heseltine Hard fight In his speech in Putney Mr Howard said he had tried his hardest to win the election I ve said many times since I became leader and during this election c aign that accountability matters I ve said that if people don t deliver then they go And for me delivering meant winning the election Tim Collins was the only shadow cabinet minister to be ousted He said the party needed to debate how it would elect his successor saying there was dissatisfaction with the rules for choosing a new leader I intend to stay as leader until the party has had the opportunity to consider whether it wishes those rules to be changed and if so how they should be changed he said When that process is complete I shall resign as leader He concluded We need to remain united never to return to the bickering and backstabbing of the past and we need to remain positive and outward looking Nasty However Labour adviser Alastair C bell said the Tories remained flat on their backs And Cabinet minister Peter Hain accused Mr Howard of leading the most ruthlessly nasty c aign that any opposition leader has fought But he has made them into a more professional fighting machine and therefore a harder opponent for the Labour Party said Mr Hain HAVE YOUR

Microsoft Home Email RSS Atom Recent Posts UAC BS Something Windows Vista Parental Controls cannot protect against What is it that makes security hard Security Features vs Convenience A couple of interesting security blog posts Tags Privacy Rant Security Vista Books Writing Secure Code nd Ed Deadly Sins of Software Security The Security Development Lifecycle Security My old Blog Archives February January December November October September August July June May April March February January December November October September August July June May April March February January December November October August July June May April March February January A New Book The Security Development Lifecycle Microsoft Press Much to my wife s chagrin but to my delight I have just completed another book this time with my boss Steve Lipner It s a bit of a departure for me as my prior books have been totally developer centric But that doesn t mean I m any less excited to do it in fact I think this book is more important than Writing Secure Code This time the book documents the Security Development Lifecycle SDL a process that we ve made part of the software development process here at Microsoft to build more secure software Many customers press analysts and to be honest competitors want to know more about what we re doing in the software engineering space to shore up our software s defenses And thanks to the SDL we ve seen good progress to date read in the range of reduction in vulnerabilities sometimes more In my opinion what sets this book apart is the fact that it s based on real world software engineering not theory and is written by two guys whose job it is to work every day with software engineers and management to help them ship more secure software We know what works and we know what doesn t work In fact many people ask me If you had to choose two things from the SDL what would they be and my answer is always the same Everything because if it doesn t work it s wouldn t be in SDL The Table of Contents for the book is Part I The Need for the SDL Chapter Enough Is Enough The Threats Have Changed Chapter Current Software Development Methods Fail to Produce Secure Software Chapter A Short History of the SDL at Microsoft Chapter SDL for Management Part II The Security Development Lifecycle Process Chapter Stage Education and Awareness Chapter Stage Project Inception Chapter Stage Define and Follow Design Best Practices Chapter Stage Product Risk Assessment Chapter Stage Risk Analysis Chapter Stage Creating Security Documents Tools and Best Practices for Customers Chapter Stage Secure Coding Policies Chapter Stage Secure Testing Policies Chapter Stage The Security Push Chapter Stage The Final Security Review Chapter Stage Security Response Planning Chapter Stage Product Release Chapter Stage Security Response Execution Part III SDL Reference Material Chapter Integrating SDL with Agile Methods Chapter SDL Banned Function Calls Chapter SDL Minimum Cryptographic Standards Chapter SDL Required Tools and Compiler Options Chapter Threat Tree Patterns We kept the book short pages to focus on the core elements of the SDL rather than blathering on All the chapters are useful but I think the most interesting chapters are these Ch Really spells out the need for security and it has nothing to do with security Ch Steve did a wonderful job of outlining the history of the SDL at Microsoft It s a real eye opener and a very candid look into the security issues we and the industry face Ch What managers need to know about implementing SDL in terms of benefit and cost Ch This is a highly updated and streamlined and more pragmatic look at our threat modeling and risk analysis framework and it includes a real world fully worked ex le Ch This chapter introduces many security testing techniques including fuzz testing and the book includes the source code for a file fuzzer Ch Another Steve chapter this is an expos of the Microsoft security response process Again it s very candid outlining many of the lessons we have learned building the best response process Ch There has been zero security guidance for Agile methods until now This chapter was written in conjunction with the MSN and Windows Live team Ch When we started threat modeling we asked development teams to build threat trees It turns out that unless you know what you re doing you will never build good threat trees Then we realized that there are threat tree patterns that apply to the various threat types This chapter outlines all the threat trees and how you can use them to design and test your application The book includes a CD that includes a six part video presentation of the Security Basics class we deliver to all new employees here Steve and I are really excited about this book in part because today is the day we sign off on it The galleys are all reviewed and the cover looks great But we re mostly excited because we believe this in an important book the first book to document REAL software development process improvements that yield more secure software It ain t perfect and that s why we update the SDL twice a year but it s a great

Technorati The growth of interconnected computers in recent years has pushed security concerns to the forefront of development and application design The Microsoft effort dubbed the Secure Windows Initiative SWI focuses on securing new and legacy code A key player on the Secure Windows Initiative team is Senior Security Program Manager Michael Howard Michael has a long history working on security related issues and has written two books along the way Writing Secure Code and Designing Secure Web based Applications for Windows both from Microsoft Press Erica Wiechers co host of the NET Show on MSDN sat down with Michael recently for an update on the security effort Here s what he had to say MSDN Microsoft is heavily focused on security issues these days How has the thinking about security changed over the past few years at Microsoft Howard Simply put threats have changed and all software must adapt to reflect the changing and frankly more dangerous landscape Security and by security I don t mean security features I mean secure features is at the forefront of everyone s thoughts at Microsoft What was previously the domain of a small bunch of specialists is now part of daily life in the various Microsoft product groups It s part of getting the job done And Bill s January e mail on Trustworthy Computing has added a huge impetus and urgency to the process MSDN What is the main charter of the Secure Windows Initiative group at Microsoft Howard Our role is simple help product groups build more secure products Our ultimate goal is to put our group out of business by seeding product groups with expertise helping them design develop test and document their products correctly and securely All product teams should get to a stage where their security effort is self sufficient over time but we are in the building phase right now so our group performs a great deal of hand holding until the teams can run on their own MSDN Describe your role in that group Howard I have many roles including security education research consulting and writing The education aspect is critical in general it s rare to find new developers who understand how to build secure software so our group fills that gap I probably spend an average of six hours a week educating people I also spend time researching things such as new threat modeling methods determining attack profiles and new vulnerability types Because of the SWI charter I also spend a good chunk of my time working with other product groups to make sure they are on track answer questions go over designs code threats test plans and so on MSDN What are some projects you are currently working on Howard You name it We just finished working with Windows XP SP and Visual Studio NET now we re onto Windows Server SQL Server Microsoft Office the next big Visual Studio NET release and much much more MSDN What do you see as the biggest challenge that developers face while trying to code secure applications Howard Legacy code is definitely the biggest challenge in that respect We think we have the new code pretty much solved People know the right things to do now that we have provided mandatory training set security rules in place improved the tools and created a huge security awareness company wide However attackers target legacy code as well as new code and the role of the various security pushes is to fix issues in both old and new code We can task people here at Microsoft to review and fix all code old and new and make it part of their job MSDN What security features would you like to see incorporated into future Microsoft products Howard I would like to see people not focus on security features In fact I truly believe that the biggest security benefit we can provide our customers is to install only critical features by default If the user wants to enable other features then they should be optional installs I say this because we can create products that defend against the threats we know about today Of course there will be new threats in the future that we do not know about today and if a feature has such a vulnerability and it is installed by default the user of that particular feature is automatically susceptible to attack and will need to deploy a security fix quickly However if the feature is rarely used and not running by default then it cannot be attacked Therefore the path deployment urgency is vastly reduced In short if a feature is not used by percent of the product s users then the feature should be disabled by default From the March issue of MSDN Magazine Back

Developer uses new technology to protect oak trees during construction Environmentally conscious property developer Michael Howard Homes is pulling out all the stops to ensure that two mature holm oak trees are protected during the construction of a luxury four bedroom house in the village of Holbrook The Dedham based developer has called in a specialist team of tree experts to carry out advanced new tree treatments using the very latest in technology to protect the roots of the holm oaks quercus ilex during the construction of a driveway to the new property which is due to be completed in the summer Mike Dewhurst from Eastwood Tree Services in Coddenham said Taking the driveway over the root system of the trees is normally detrimental to the structure of the roots but with new technology and materials the damaging effect can be dramatically reduced We will be feeding the root system by injecting into it special products that will develop the root system to become more efficient in extracting water and nutrients from the soil thus enabling the trees to overcome the stress of the new entrance The root system of a mature tree can extend between one and two times the height and spread of the tree The main feeding roots of a tree are located within the first mm of the soil level so any compaction or soil removed will cause damage without specialist equipment being used We will be using a special air spade that allows us to excavate within the root system without any long term damage to the health of the tree added Mike Dewhurst This is cutting edge tree care and our staff our fully trained in this new approach and we are specialists in this field Builders are not normally sympathetic to trees and Michael Howard Home s taking the trouble and expense to protect these holm oaks is an excellent ex le of a professional builder working with a professional tree company The driveway being installed over the root system will spread the weight of the vehicles by means of a very strong mesh allowing the weight to be spread over the roots It will be constructed of a porous material enabling the water to percolate into the root system and air and gases to be exchanged Adrian Mann left Construction Director Michael Howard Homes and Michael Dewhurst MD Eastwood Tree Services inspecting Holm Oak tree in Holbrook Pruning of Holm Oak and aerating soil without damaging vital root system Michael Howard Homes is experienced in building in conservation areas and builds properties with empathy for the area in which it is developing The protection of the environment in which we build is of great importance to us and we will invest wherever possible in the necessary support and services to enable us to maintain the environment during construction said Michael Howard Homes construction director Adrian Mann Eastwood Tree Services was the obvious choice for this project as its staff are experienced and highly trained in this unusual field This is an expensive operation but we believe it is more than worth it to protect these beautiful old trees The holm oaks will be monitored over the next two years to make sure they retain their beauty in the village The new property Holm Oaks will be completed in August It is set on a secluded plot in the heart of Holbrook and will be of brick and tile construction using reclaimed roof tiles Michael

was so contaminated that it had become potentially harmful to the environment Michael Howard Homes demolished former The Mallard restaurant on the site and cleared some tonnes of contaminated waste from the area to make it safe and suitable for development This was a very difficult and hugely expensive clean up operation due to the extent of the contamination and the fact that the site is close to a river said Adrian Mann construction director of Dedham based Michael Howard Homes Michael Howard Homes consulted closely with Colchester Borough Council planners and the Dedham Vale Society to produced agreed plans for the new property Millstream House which will be a five bedroom house featuring a four car lodge and bottle wine cellar It will be built using traditional methods and incorporating locally reclaimed materials The company is used to building on brownfield sites in conservation areas and builds properties with empathy for the area in which it is developing Mr Mann says that the appearance of the individually designed Millstream House will be in keeping with the village of Dedham Michael Howard Homes specialises in designing building and refurbishing individual properties of distinction and style paying great attention to detail and using only the finest quality materials Ends For further information please contact Caroline Gasking Pink Creative Marketing

Columnists Market Insight Sports Culture Bloomberg RSS Audio Video Reports RESOURCES Bloomberg TV Bloomberg Radio Markets Bloomberg Columnists E Mail This Story Printer Friendly Format Matthew Lynn is a columnist for Bloomberg News The opinions expressed are his own Howard s Bid for U K Prime Minister Is Long Shot New Bio Says April Bloomberg With the c aign for U K prime minister in full swing the title of Michael Crick s new biography In Search of Michael Howard Simon Schuster pounds pages seems slightly unfortunate Right now going in search of Howard is like going in search of your big toe You just look down and there it is Howard is dominating television screen and newspapers in a highly personalized pitch for votes as the May election approaches Few people in Britain would be surprised to find him knocking on the door personally possibly offering to help out with a few chores around the house That s about the only unfortunate thing about this book The year old Howard could just conceivably become prime minister yet he remains a strangely unknown figure Crick has delivered the most comprehensive guide to the man yet published At the end of its pages Howard emerges as a more likeable and substantial figure than most people would imagine Crick is an able and experienced biographer whose past subjects include another Welsh Conservative politician Michael Heseltine and the Manchester United soccer manager Sir Alex Ferguson His publishers have promoted him as a kind of biographical butcher The five most feared words in the election lexicography Michael Crick is in reception says the blurb on the back jacket No Cooperation In keeping with that reputation Crick remarks in his introduction that he prefers not to have the cooperation of his biographical subjects While Howard didn t help with the biography he also didn t try to stop it Crick conducted numerous interviews with Howard s friends and family for the book Howard s family was part of the wave of Eastern European Jews who moved to Britain in the s The fact he could rise so far is a mark of how socially mobile postwar Britain had become His father Bernat Hecht who later changed his name to Howard was born in the rural Romanian district of Ruscova Visit Ruscova today and you get vivid glimpses of what agrarian life was like in Europe for most of the last thousand years writes Crick The village economy is still largely self sufficient much of what people eat and wear is produced locally Without piped water citizens still draw supplies from wells and for most homes the lavatory is a wooden hut over a hole in the backyard Many peasants wear much the same clothes and perform the same daily tasks as their forebears in medieval times President of Romania If his father had stayed put instead of moving to South Wales and opening a clothing shop Howard might be running for president of Romania His brand of right wing tax cutting policies might go down better there than they do in Britain Romania has just introduced a flat tax Howard went to the local grammar school then Cambridge University Even before attending university he was a Conservative To declare oneself a Conservative was a brave act in a town where Labour took two thirds of the vote in the election won nationally by the Tories and where almost one in ten of the workforce had no job writes Crick Like Margaret Thatcher Howard is a Conservative by ideological conviction rather than class background Howard made his career in the law and fought several elections unsuccessfully before entering Parliament in Model Wife Along the way he married well Sandra Paul was a top s fashion model who achieved the notable distinction of being the first English girl to make the cover of the American edition of Vogue for two months in a row The elegant Sandra remains one of her husband s greatest electoral assets Howard became Home Secretary in John Major s government There he shifted crime policy decisively to the right Howard saw the Home Office as one of the few departments to have escaped the Thatcher Revolution and he felt that it was deeply imbued with the culture of what he called the criminal justice establishment writes Crick He wanted to challenge its existing assumptions Liberals naturally enough hated it But Labour has done nothing to reverse his policies and most of the world has moved toward a tougher stance on crime since the early s It is to Howard s credit that he got there first He is not just a politician who thinks deeply about the issues he also thinks about how to push change through the system often a much harder task After losing the leadership to William Hague in Howard finally became leader of his party in Crick takes the fashionable view that the Conservative politician stands little chance against the formidable Blair Howard seems to be leading his party to another calamitous defeat in the impending election Crick concludes Tingle Factor Most successful politicians Tony Blair Michael Heseltine Michael Portillo Bill Clinton inspire or excite or at least interest the public he continues The nearest Michael Howard has to a tingle factor is his wife Sandra Like many journalists Crick tends to see politics as a branch of show business His list of successful politicians is revealing two men who didn t become Tory leader and two left wing politicians who though electorally successful achieved very little They are all people who were good at the show but not so good at the business The point Crick misses is that although Howard may be a relatively poor c aigner who finds it hard to connect with ordinary voters he is an effective administrator That contrasts with Blair who is a brilliant c aigner but a shambolic administrator What this biography actually tells us is that Howard would be an effective possibly brilliant prime minister Do the voters care about that We ll find out next month Last Updated April EDT copy Bloomberg L

'MICHAEL HOWARD SUDAN MISSIONARY Kalibu Acdemy www kalibu com in southern Sudan KALIBU ACADEMY MALAWI MICHAEL Means WHO is LIKE GOD MICHAEL KNOWS ISLAM MUSLIMS Sudan Kalibu Academy In the heart of the civil war in the midst of war famine horrible stories of oppressions continual bombings by Khartoum recent missile attack there is ONE place in New Sudan that stands out as a source of hope a lighthouse for the Gospel of Jesus Christ the new Bible School located in Yei When GOD told Michael to move to Sudan to preach Jesus Christ Michael said Find sommeone else GOD said There IS no one else so Michael moved to Sudan and started a Bible School He s won many to the Lord and has witnessed MANY miracles Michael is a VERY INSPIRING speaker Powerful man of GOD The TRUTH you DON T HEAR Michael Howard was born in Bulawayo Zimbabwe Africa He made his commitment to the Lord while in high school shortly before completing college he decided that his life was to be totally dedicated to the Lord and to the salvation of souls He was ordained under Assemblies of God in Zimbabwe pastored for years before moving to Chipinge on the eastern border with Mozambique It was there that God gave the vision for a missionary organization and Shekinah Ministries was birthed in the Spirit Michael under the guidance of the Holy Spirit began to operate in the areas where no others would go Michael takes his teams to bring life out of death situations and hope to the helpless The life and hope that only the Lord Jesus Christ can bring Michael is a fascinating captivating and inspiring speaker Someone MUST make a documentary of this man s experiences they are graphic He gives personal testimony his personal experience of God s miracles in the Sudan He deals with muslims and has seen them saved and filled with Jesus Christ Our LORD is REAL to this man as Jesus is not this real to most Christians Here is a report a couple of my brief notes I can NOT do justice to this human dynamo on whom God s Hand rests MICHAEL HOWARD speaking and My comments on what Michael said Michael lives in the Sudan Southern Sudan is not all arab The muslims have asked China to come kill all non muslims in the south Sudan where Michael s bunch are China wants LAND so muslims will give China a year lease if they get rid of them Michael Howard started a Bible School there and these guys will DIE for Jesus Christ Allah is NOT OUR GOD Allah is a demon prince Perhaps the prince of Persia who withstood Daniel There are million muslims in America This means there are million TERRORISTS in our land If the leader of Islam declares a jihad holy war against the USA we will see suicide bombers in America as Israel is experiencing now Bill Clinton fought on the WRONG SIDE in Kosovo He bombed the christians and saved the muslims and brought terrorists into the USA Who is responsible CNN s Christiana Amanpour who is Iranian made the Kosovons so pathetic NOTE June the arab leaders in the MidEast did declare the USA an enemy Link below PLO leaders target U S Call for masses to take action on ground www worldnetdaily com news article asp ARTICLE_ID HOW DO YOU FIGHT ISLAM They say You christians are afraid to DIE for Jesus Libya s QUADAFI actually said the ONLY thing he d fear is the Church of Jesus Christ IF it woke up but it s fast asleep Muslim soldiers captured Michael saying We KILL you We KILL you Michael said You CAN T kill me I belong to JESUS His LACK of fear of death frightened this troup of soldiers and he gave each of them a Bible and they knelt and received Christ right there PRAISE OUR GOD HALLELUJAH I want to tell you how inspiring Michael is as a speaker God protects them The muslims dropped two bombs right on top of their Bible school Michael watched them fall and said GOD DO SOMETHING God said hush I have this under control Watch I will show you a miracle God showed many miracles to Michael The bombs headed straight down for the school Suddenly one veered at a right angel to the RIGHT and the other to the LEFT both fell OUTSIDE the zone and exploded leaving the school untouched The Sudanese are afraid of Michael and his people They are afraid of our GOD Michael s people drove back n forth across mines none went off for months When a badguy drove across after months BOOM The word went out DONT TOUCH THESE GUYS GOD is with them Several such occurences That Sudan aspirin factory did indeed make chemical weapons Every day these chemical bombs are dropped on Sudan so that Michael and his students sleep with a wet towel I think he said wrapped around their faces The chemicals settle down around them at night The US is and must stand by Israel Islam may well include America in jihad I could go on and on with his stories CHRISTIANS in AMERICA JESUS CHRIST is the SAME YESTERDAY TODAY and FOREVER REMEMBER THIS Our HOPE is in the LORD Psalm tells us we are safe in Him As a believer you were created not only to influence people for Jesus as you shared the good news but also to pray expect the power of God to touch their lives when you prayed with them It was the signs and miracles that helped those whom were touched understand the awesomeness of God s love compassion toward them It was the heart of compassion not spiritual pride that led Paul to pray and obey and do what Jesus did preach expecting miracles signs and wonders to follow As Paul obeyed the Lord and expected the power of God to follow what He ministered his faith grew his compassion grew lives were saved delivered healed made whole BOOKS by MICHAEL HOWARD TALES

Prussian War is an unusual conflict in that it is in many ways a study in contrasts Historically it set the stage for two twentieth century conflagrations even as it settled scores from the early nineteenth century Politically it marked the zenith of French national influence and the ascendancy of a united German power Finally militarily it offered the first widespread use of breech loading rifles and modern artillery even as it often languished in the tactics of an earlier age It takes a broad brush to capture all of these elements and in this book Michael Howard has succeeded admirably He has taken an often overlooked conflict and placed it squarely at the crossroads of modern Europe and a new more terrible type of war For while the American Civil War or even the Crimean War is often referred to as the first modern war it is in fact in the Franco Prussian War that we see all the key elements of modern warfare national mobilization citizen soldiers under the guidance of a professional general staff and the ascendancy of industrialization in both transport and new more destructive weapons At the same time newer more insidious developments in the form of guerrilla warfare and the targeting of civilians centers for strategic reasons first make their appearance on a large scale Arising out of French objections to the Prussian selection of the Spanish monarch this war like many before and since arose out of a complete lack of French appreciation for the changes that had overtaken the battlefield While the French had relied on a small professional army the Prussians had adopted a model of mandatory service that allowed them to raise massive reasonably competent forces with unprecedented speed Thus when hostilities broke out the French who had assumed an easy victory were caught on their heels and never regained the initiative Thus from the summer of through the depths of winter and into the story of the Franco Prussian War is the story of the courage of the French soldier being failed utterly by inept leadership It wasn t in the strength of Prussian arms or in the courage of its soldiers that the war was won rather it was in the ability of the centralized Prussian command structure to adapt rapidly to events when their French counterparts were still in the dark that victory was secured Thus while Howard s writing on the actual combat is vivid it is in his appreciation of the fundamentally new Prussian way of war that he is most successful From the king through the Bismarck and Moltke and on down through the rest of the senior command he paints a vivid portrait of Prussian ideals and ambition Conversely he is equally successful at capturing the decrepitude and ineptness of a fragmented French government that lost the war in its opening days and then prolonged it to the never ending suffering of its soldiers long after all hope was lost Likewise along these lines Howard nicely illustrates the increasing conflict that inevitable comes between politicians and the military in an era of total war That said I do have a few minor complaints The first is that Howard almost never translates es from the original French or German and while I was just barely able to muddle through with what I remember from high school and college any one who hasn t been exposed to these languages would certainly be frustrated Secondly as anyone familiar with European politics knows nothing happens in a vacuum and yet Howard spends precious little time discussing the implications of the conflict within the international system of the time Finally while Howard offers many maps they offer little to know information about troop positions and lines of march which leaves the reader flipping back rather than digesting a detailed map at a glance However these are minor complaints about an otherwise eminently successful work Howard has packed a tremendous amount of research into a readable and digestible volume His appreciation of the politics and personalities is matched only by his understanding of the weapons of war and the nature of combat Not only is this a successful history of the Franco Prussian war but also a model of what good history writing should be balanced well researched and above all readable Finally Howard s success elevates the Franco Prussian War to its rightful significance as one of the root causes of the tensions that led to WWI and hence to WWII Thus the student of history should appreciate this work not just for its success in considering immediate events but for providing a bridge from the Great Power politics of the nineteenth century to the wars of the twentieth Jake Mohlman Comment Was this review helpful to you Report this of people found the following review helpful The French Military Debacle of January Reviewer Timothy J Graczewski tgraczewski Burlingame CA United States See all my reviews It seems in retrospect as though fate had decided that there should be no humiliation which the French army should be spared That one sentence accurately captures the tenor of Michael Howard s masterful history of the Franco Prussian War First published in and representing Howard s debut as a military historian his history of the stunning Prussian victory over the heavily favored French has stood the test of time and rightfully confirmed his place as one of the preeminent historians of war in the twentieth century Howard tells the story of the war primarily from the French perspective and it is a stinging indictment of that country s political and military system at that time Disgraced French commanders such as Bazaine or Bourbaki are more pitied by Howard than criticized for their performance He argues that primary fault for the disasters that befell the French armies were more the product of a defective French military system that put such incompetent men in command of large armies rather than the fault of the incompetent commanders themselves Only occasionally does Howard divert his attention to the Prussian side and when he does it is most often to discuss the friction generated between Moltke and Bismark or to describe the usually quick and effective Prussian reaction to halting or diffident French moves However Howard seems to place no stock in the notion of a German genius for war For instance he is quick to point out the many mistakes Moltke s army made particularly in the early days of the conflict and notes that more often than not the French troops gave just as good as they got in open battles with the Germans In many ways the Franco Prussian War marked the culmination of the dramatic military reforms begun by Scharnhorst after the disastrous defeat at the hands of Napoleon at the Battle of Jena in Prussian improvements in military recruitment training and organization and most notably the development of a General Staff responsible for managing the immense requirements of modern war were all brought to bear on the French and in many accounts is credited with the stunning victory Howard recognizes the revolutionary implications of the railroad telegraph and rifled weaponry and also notes the decisive influence Prussian military planning and organization had in the conflict Indeed he notes that the war was a watershed event in military history On the one hand the conflict included perhaps the last successful cavalry charge in history as well as the final employment of Vauban s time honored siegecraft techniques developed in the th century Yet the war also held some harbingers of future warfare such as the deliberate bombardment of civilian populations at Strasburg and Paris in an attempt to undermine civilian morale and storm troop tactics developed to minimize casualties in attacking positions defended by troops with rapid firing rifled weaponry Nevertheless in the final analysis Howard seems to credit the French more with defeat than the Prussians with victory Finally it should be noted there are a lack of adequate c aigns maps which makes many portions of the book difficult to follow Comment Was this review helpful to you Report this Customer Reviews Average Customer Review Write an

enough about the Franco Prussian War to criticize the research and the facts presented But this is certainly not an enjoyable book to read If that is a factor for you be warned Comment Was this review helpful to you Report this of people found the following review helpful Boring but informative May Reviewer George Dimitriou georgestuff mays landing nj United States See all my reviews I actually have not finished the book yet so forgive my hypocrisy From an information and accuracy perspective it is probably the best book on the war However it is a bit of a tough read so be prepared Howard details technology and warfare of the time along with politics and the like and the book doesn t miss much However perhaps that is the reason it seems so long overall I would say a good book Comment Was this review helpful to you Report this of people found the following review helpful an authoritative treatment of a complex conflict September Reviewer doc peterson Portland Oregon USA See all my reviews Howard does a masterful job in detailing the the military preparations of both sides before the conflict describing the war itself and even going into some detail about the increasing importance of technology in modern warfare especially transport However there are some shortcommings the chief among them are the maps While they are useful in giving the reader an idea of what happened where they really needed to be more detailed showing troop movements and positions I also thought the lack of perspective on the war was disappointing after all the Franco Prussian war was instrumental in the creation of German nationhood the birth of the Fourth republic and a foundation stone of the First World War None of these important after effects were discussed in any detail whatsoever As a book of pure military history though Howard s book is beyond reproach Comment Was this review helpful to you Report this of people found the following review helpful Brisk and Detailed April Reviewer michael McKinney TX United States See all my reviews This is a very detailed account of the military and to a lesser extent political maneuverings of the Franco Prussian War Given the detail and the heavy footnoting it is a surprisingly brisk read though I do have one suggestion to assist future readers photocopy the various pages that have maps on them so you can easily refer to them as you read on Since I hadn t thought of this idea while reading the book I found myself holding two or even three such pages open with the fingers of my left hand while reading battle descriptions many many pages later One disappointment was in the very brief epilogue The author discusses how the speed of the Prussian victory raised the stakes for all European powers Germany in particular but the author does not really discuss the aftermath of the war in France or explain how France formed a post war government given the fractious way it had fought the war Every history needs to stop at some point of course but a brief explanation of France s recovery seems in order Comment Was this review helpful to you Report this See all customer reviews Customer Discussions Beta

Michael Howard Andrew Roth Friday March Guardian Unlimited Michael Howard the former Tory home secretary is one of those half ghosts from Tory cabinets who materialise on the backbenches to indicate that they are not quite dead to do a spot of Labour bashing In his case one can almost see the dagger in his back inscribed something of the night Piquantly Ann Widdecombe his former junior who thus maligned him has surged into popularity as the more rightwing alternative to Michael Portillo and potential successor to William Hague Article continues Mr Howard was the last of the Tory Cambridge Mafia of the s which included Kenneth Clarke John Gummer Norman Fowler and Leon Brittan to retire to the back benches He came up via Llanelli grammar school in Gorseinon near Swansea where his Romanian Jewish shopkeeper father had settled At school he was one of only two Jewish pupils The family name of Hecht was anglicised to Howard In and he contested two parliamentary elections for the Conservative party at Edge Hill Liverpool before finding a safe seat years later in Folkestone and Hythe The delay was partly because of his desire to make his way as a successful barrister in planning and employment law but also provided a chance to cement his marriage to ex model Saundra Paul her fourth his first Once in the Commons Mr Howard established his rightwing views In his maiden speech he urged legal protection for strike breakers and endorsed the restoration of the death penalty and US intervention in Grenada Within two years he had begun his climb up the greasy pole of politics A populist home secretary from to John Major s election defeat he fought crime by locking people up to the dismay of top judges and his more centrist predecessors like Douglas Hurd His tough line saw crime drop by and made him the darling of the tabloids but he was seriously undermined by his handling of the resignation of the Derek Lewis the director of prisons in Mr Lewis fell on his sword when a report into the escape of prisoners from Whitemoor prison highlighted serious deficiencies in the system Mr Howard almost suffered the same fate when he was asked about whether he had made Mr Lewis a scapegoat times by Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight Despite this public relations disaster Mr Howard managed to maintain widespread support in the press due to his Europhobia As the senior Eurosceptic in John Major s cabinet he pursued many battles with Europhile Ken Clarke and seemed well placed to succeed Mr Major This hope was destroyed in the first round of the Tory leadership battle following their May defeat After William Hague reneged on a deal to run as Mr Howard s deputy Mr Howard came fifth with votes He then backed the much younger man and was rewarded with the post of shadow foreign secretary He spent the next two years doing little else other than demanding Robin Cook s resignation Although still very pro American and against a federal Europe Mr Howard no longer fitted in with Hague s Little England Europhobes who criticised him for supporting Nato s attack on Serbia as a just war After Mr Hague announced plans for kitchen table Conservatism in March Mr Howard retired from frontbench politics to the relative comfort of his well cushioned boardrooms There he can exhibit his QC s mind expressed with a slight Welsh accent in his smoothly courteous personal manner The departure of Derek Lewis made an enemy of Ann Widdecombe and probably ended Mr Howard s chances of becoming leader He must often think what might have been if those convicts had

extra personal finance travel education subscribe home delivery eNewsletter archives today s edition am past days site guide contact us Home World News Article Another Howard man most likely to challenge Blair October AM Print this article Email to a friend Michael Howard looks on as his leader bows out Photo AFP Most people who have had personal dealings with Michael Howard have found him an engaging and scrupulously polite individual He is articulate as befits a QC fiercely intelligent and honest Yet his image in the country is as a ruthless Right wing ideologue someone who intimidated Whitehall officials and who places ambition ahead of principle He was once called the most hated home secretary in living memory Ann Widdecombe who served as his deputy at the Home Office said there was something of the night about him an opaque yet intentionally unflattering description that has stalked him ever since and probably always will Rarely in politics has the public persona so belied the private man How has this demonisation come about It derives principally from his time as home secretary when his insistence on tougher penalties for criminals offended the sensibilities of the liberals whose law and order policies had so palpably failed that the Tory government faced the gravest crime crisis in history Mr Howard s tough line famously set out in his points at the Conservative conference in also found little favour with the judiciary who felt that their independence was being constrained They fought his attempts at reform tooth and nail feeding an impression of ministerial disarray that by then had infected the entire Tory government Yet there is little that Mr Howard proposed then that was not taken up by the Labour government in and built on subsequently by Jack Straw and now David Blunkett The penal slogan most commonly associated with Mr Howard is prison works From the moment he became home secretary a stewardship that began with the public angst generated by the appalling murder of Jamie Bulger by two year old boys the prison population began to increase But this was not the direct consequence of any legislation more a response by the courts to a perceived desire on the part of the public articulated by politicians for tougher sentences Mr Howard s most draconian measures the so called three strikes and you re out provision for repeat burglars and mandatory sentences for serial drug traffickers were actually enacted by Labour after Furthermore the prison population has risen even faster under the current Government without its ministers attracting the same opprobrium Mr Howard s time at the Home Office was blighted by several high profile prison escapes and there is no question that he might have handled the fall out better He gave the impression of a politician seeking to blame his officials Derek Lewis the director general of the Prison Service was fired Miss Widdecombe s animus stems from this period But the fact remains that burglaries and car thefts began to fall from onwards when measured by the British Crime Survey which is the current Government s favoured benchmark It is a record for which a home secretary might in other circumstances expect congratulations Mr Howard however merely endured brickbats This was as much a function of the terminal decline of the Major government which Mr Howard came to epitomise as a coherent critique of his achievements His earlier ministerial association with the poll tax though his were not the only fingerprints at the scene and the privatisation of water now uncontroversial then mightily divisive contributed to the image His opposition to further European integration offended Europhile Tories at the time but is now mainstream party policy As home secretary he made mistakes and suffered defeats He was probably wrong to increase the sentence tariff on the Bulger killers but he felt it was his function to reflect public revulsion Like Mr Blunkett he wanted to introduce ID cards but was beaten back by a cabinet revolt He tried to limit trial by jury just as the present Government is doing but lost in the Lords He introduced an ill considered ban on handguns but after the Dunblane massacre the political pressure for prohibition was almost irresistable However there is a good deal of revisionism now taking place about Mr Howard s stewardship of the Home Office His predecessors Douglas Hurd and Kenneth Clarke are seen as too soft during their time in the post the crime level grew to more than five million Even today the criminal justice measures he wanted to introduce then are going through Parliament in one shape or another making it difficult for Labour to traduce his time at the Home Office Born in south Wales in the son of Jewish immigrants from Romania Michael Howard was educated at Llanelli Grammar School He went on to study law at Cambridge where his debating skills made him a star of the Union His contemporaries included Kenneth Clarke Norman Lamont John Gummer Leon Brittan and Norman Fowler a group of friends who became known as the Cambridge mafia Two decades later they occupied the upper reaches of the Thatcher and Major cabinets though Mr Howard arrived at Westminster later after searching forlornly for a seat and then practising as a planning lawyer In the meantime he had married Sandra Paul a Sixties model who calls him an extraordinarily romantic man They have two children and one of the strongest of Westminster marriages After he became MP for Folkestone in his rise was meteoric and he reached the Cabinet within seven years By he was well positioned to challenge for the succession to John Major yet secured just votes from his fellow MPs trailing in last Some felt he was too clever by half others that he trimmed his sails according to the prevailing political winds Their suspicions were articulated by Miss Widdecombe At this point it must have been tempting to return to the Bar or earn a lot of money in the City Instead he took up the post of shadow foreign secretary under William Hague for two years before returning to the backbenches When Iain Duncan Smith took over in Mr Howard was the surprise choice as shadow chancellor where he swiftly consolidated his reputation as a forensic and powerful Commons performer Yet while his qualities are known to his colleagues and his parliamentary skills are unquestionable he will have the hardest task persuading voters that he is not an unfeeling and faintly sinister throwback to the Major era It is a caricature that Mr Howard s friends find hard to fathom His interests are catholic he likes football Liverpool is his team and horse racing he enjoys a wide range of music from jazz to pop he rarely speaks disparagingly of colleagues even in private an unusual trait among politicians He is fiercely loyal Throughout the recent Tory leadership fiasco few will have heard him utter anything derogatory about Mr Duncan Smith He was standing by the Tory leader outside Conservative Central Office on Tuesday just as he stood by Mr Major in his troubled times In his memoirs Mr Major wrote Michael is clever and able but in private is a shy and charming man with an unstuffy self deprecating manner He was always at his best without an audience in public he could not help stirring things up Too many people saw the polished barrister on the surface and took against what they saw They missed the substance underneath If he becomes Tory leader that substance will be sorely tested over the

'MICHAEL HOWARD CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT GENERAL ELECTION VOTES TAX TAXATION RATES AND COUNCIL TAX MICHAEL HOWARD CONSERVATIVE MP HOME CUISINE ENVIRONMENT INSURANCE HORSES LEGENDS LAW NEWS PRODUCE RIGHTS SITE INDEX TRANSPORT WHISTLEBLOWING Michael Howard launches Conservative Election C aign Michael Howard has launched the party s general election c aign with a rousing rallycall to the country to abandon the failed policies of Tony Blair s Labour Party and turn to the Conservatives to give the nation a fresh start But has he said anything about tackling council corruption Not as far as we know Should he not be promising voters that he will put a halt to the extraordinary waste of ratepayers money brought on by corrupt planning officers We estimate this waste to be in the order of million per council That adds up to a tidy sum Enough to bail out just about every other shortage in public funding Michael Howard MP Why do you think politicians need to resort to stealth taxes Take Road Tax This tax was introduced to pay for road building yet only about actually goes to build roads The rest is diverted to support other high spend areas such as protecting crooked planning officers We need honest taxes for honest purposes We need an efficient government and an efficient local government We do not need dishonest local officials milking the system for their own purposes Building empires We need affordable housing decent schools and sensibly priced services At the moment council tax is crippling most folk Not to mention the fact is is a grossly unfair tax aimed only at people who are sitting targets Can the Conservatives under Michael Howard deliver the above We doubt it The Conservatives have not tackled white collar crime at local council level before true they commissioned Lord Nolan to look into the situation But as soon as the awful truth emerged via a recommendation for new criminal statute to tackle malicious use of public funds and personal vendettas they hastily put the brakes on Cowards Nelson Kruschandl says It s Time for Change Neither the Conservatives or New Labour have tackled white collar crime at local council level Both of these parties allow local council s to run riot with your money allow council officers to deceive councillors and torture the public by refusing to answer reasonable questions the threatening citizens with legal action where these same planning officers know developments are permitted and is some cases harassing members of the public to bankruptcy at huge expense to the ratepayer See Staffordshire County Council and Brian Goodacre as prime ex les The major political parties are simply Chicken Then as soon as the Human Rights Act looked set to give the common man a chance they changed the rules regarding Legal Aid funding making it almost impossible to obtain representation and justice Speaking before the Prime Minister travelled from Downing Street to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen to dissolve Parliament Mr Howard put his party on the front foot with a promise to do the best for Britain with an action programme that would reward the hardworking law abiding majority while delivering improved school discipline cleaner hospitals more police on the streets and controlled immigration Kicking off the party c aign in the courtyard of a central London hotel he declared The choice before the voters on May is very clear they can either reward Mr Blair for eight years of broken promises and vote for another five years of talk or they can vote Conservative to support a party that s taken a stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hard working Britons Insisting that the Labour government has lost the plot Mr Howard accused Tony Blair of taking honest hardworking people for granted and failing to recognise how worried NHS patients are about hospital infections how pensions are fearful of rising crime and how parents fear that their children cannot learn in class because of the lack of proper school discipline Denouncing the way Labour has frittered away huge tax incomes with little improvement in public services Mr Howard offered a better way which would help those who do the right thing and play by the rules He said the Conservative timetable for action would build a brighter better future for the country with more value for money and lower taxes with discipline restored to schools with hospital matrons given the power to close wards infected with MRSA with reduced crime and an extra more police officers on the streets each year backed by tougher sentences for burglars and drug dealers and controlled immigration with an annual limit on the number of people who can settle in Britain He declared Some people say I shouldn t talk about difficult issues like the abuse of our asylum system and those travellers who stick two fingers up to the law But we cannot make Britain a better place if we sweep difficult issues under the carpet Everyone knows you won t fix a problem if you aren t even prepared to discuss it Mr Howard said he was not prepared to appease special interest groups and wanted all Britons to play by the same rules Buoyed up by improving opinion poll surveys and a party brimming with confidence and enthusiasm Mr Howard said that while the Prime Minister was already secretly grinning about the prospect of his third victory there was no reason why the country had to deliver Labour a third term in Downing Street And in a clear message to the electorate he embarked on a vigorous four week nationwide c aign declaring If you re thinking what we re thinking it s time for urgent action on the things that really matter reward for hardworking Britons school discipline cleaner hospitals more police and controlled immigration So I say again the choice before voters on May the fifth is very clear They can either reward Mr Blair for eight years of broken promises and vote for another five years of talk Or they can vote Conservative to support a party that s taken a stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hard working Britons Michael and Sandra Howard The issues that matter to hard working Britons Speech launching election c aign in the South in Winchester The choice before voters on May the fifth is very clear They can either reward Mr Blair for eight years of broken promises and vote for another five years of talk Or they can vote Conservative to support a party that s taken a stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hard working Britons Conservatives will restore discipline in our classrooms by giving head teachers control over their schools We will clean up our hospitals by giving matrons the power to close wards that are infected with MRSA We will cut crime by each year putting more police officers real police officers on our streets and introducing tougher sentences for burglars and drug dealers We will reduce immigration by setting an annual limit on the number of people who can come and settle in Britain And we will reward hardworking Britons by giving them value for money and lower taxes People work hard for their money and they deserve to keep more of it Mr Blair promised that he had no plans to increase tax at all But he has put taxes up times mostly by stealth And it s hurting According to the independent Institute for fiscal studies average incomes have started to fall for the first time in ten years It s not the rich getting soaked It is normal hard working families trying to make ends meet And if Mr Blair gets in again taxes will go up again Rarely in the history of politics has a government spent so much taxed so much and achieved so little People work hard they pay their taxes and they deserve value for their money But today families are paying an average of in extra tax a year and what have they got to show for it Everyone knows there is no such thing as a free lunch With Mr Blair you pay for lunch and it never seems to turn up Britain cannot carry on indefinitely spending more than it is earning without higher taxes or higher interest rates If we are to secure our future economic prosperity government must once again start to live within its means There are two Britains today private sector Britain where people are working harder just to stand still struggling just to make ends meet And bureaucratic Britain where money is no object you spend what you like you employ who you like For every job the private sector lost last year the public sector took on almost two more Britain cannot carry on like this without storing up huge problems for the future You know a country is living on borrowed time when government is the fastest growing industry in town So we have a plan to get a grip on government spending That s why a Conservative government will cut waste There ll be per cent fewer MPs and per cent fewer government ministers Over quangos will disappear bureaucratic posts will go We ll scrap the New Deal There ll be no new Supreme Court And as for those unelected unaccountable regional assemblies the playthings of John Prescott we ll get rid of them too Yes these decisions are tough but they are right Right because they ll get resources to the front line to our schools and hospitals giving taxpayers value for their money Right because they ll help pay of debt and avoid Mr Blair s tax rises And right because they ll enable a Conservative to lower taxes Do you really believe this man I believe that families are better at spending their hard earned cash than any politician That is why Conservatives will cut taxes The hardest hit by Labour s stealth taxes have been the older generation If you want to know about a family look at how they treat their older relatives And if you want to know about a country look at how it cares for its older generation How a country treats the older generation is a test of its values Many served our country in her greatest hour of need fighting for liberty freedom and Britain s independence for future generations We must never forget the contribution they have made and continue to make to our communities But in Britain today too many pensioners are not shown the respect they deserve or given the dignity that is their due The older generation don t seem to feature in Mr Blair s New Britain New Labour s Britain is a country where the older generation has been airbrushed out As Frank Field Mr Blair s own former social security minister has said Labour took one of the best pensions systems in Europe and turned into one of the worst People who saved for their retirement suddenly found that the money they d put aside simply wasn t there that the value of their pensions had been destroyed by Mr Blair s stealth taxes And Labour have forced nearly half all pensioners are onto means testing Pensioners quite rightly resent means testing It is at total odds with the values of the forgotten majority the people who work hard who take responsibility for themselves and save for their retirement Means testing is wrong It penalises people for doing the right thing saving for their retirement It sends a clear signal to the younger generation Don t bother to save Spend whatever you can before you retire because your future is one of dependency on the State Means testing is humiliating forcing pensioners to go cap in hand to the State for what they are due And means testing is complicated That s why over one and a half million eligible pensioners don t even claim what they are owed I want our country to honour our senior citizens cherish their wisdom and care for their needs a country where they can live in security and with dignity respected and protected To those who have given so much we must surely give what is their due I will increase the basic state pension in line with earnings making pensioners up to a week better off after four years By increasing the basic pension we will free hundreds of thousands pensioners from the tyranny of means tested benefits restoring their dignity independence and self respect I will give every home where the adults are sixty five and over a fifty per cent Council Tax discount up to a maximum of This will ensure that Council Tax bills for five million pensioners are cut Taken together these proposals will mean that pensioner households will be up to a year better off it s a thousand pounds And I will stop the disgrace of elderly people being forced to sell their homes saying goodbye forever to their independence to pay for their residential care Smile and wave goodbye to you taxes It s important that government rewards people who work hard and have contributed to our society And it s important too that government upholds the law Some people say I shouldn t talk about difficult issues like the abuse of our asylum system and those travellers who stick two fingers up to the law But we cannot make Britain a better place if we sweep difficult issues under the carpet Everyone knows you won t fix a problem if you aren t even prepared to discuss it I m not prepared to appease special interest groups because I believe passionately in fair play We are all British and we should all have to play by the same rules Nor will I be distracted from doing what I believe is best for Britain by the smirking politics of Mr Blair or the woolly thinking of the Liberal Democrats So on each of these issues on rewarding those who work hard and have contributed to our country on schools on hospitals on crime and on immigration we have a detailed published Timetable for Action so you can hold us to account Look for this commitment in your paper check it on the net put it up on your fridge door hold me to it And beware yet another election where Mr Blair says one thing to get your vote on polling day and does something quite different afterwards Mr Blair is already secretly grinning about the prospect of his third victory Imagine five more years of him Well you don t have to settle for it If you re thinking what we re thinking it s time for urgent action on the things that really matter Reward for hardworking Britons School discipline Cleaner hospitals More police and Controlled immigration So I say again the choice before voters on May the fifth is very clear They can either reward Mr Blair for eight years of broken promises and vote for another five years of talk Or they can vote Conservative to support a party that s taken a stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hard working Britons CONSERVATIVE PARTY LINKS Newsroom News headlines Speeches Multimedia Blogs Recent press releases Articles Local Govt Results News archive MEP news Media Centre News

Schuster Die Zeit Herfried M uuml nkler Review Consensus Generally enthusiastic though reviews are more descriptive than critical From the Reviews Howard s panoramic glance over the major trends of war does not so much reveal the invention of peace as the ongoing re invention of war And it is quite sobering While his survey spotlights the reality of humanity s long love affair with war in the end The Invention of Peace disappointed me because there was no serious analysis about how we can get ourselves out of this self destructive addiction to war Indeed he concludes that there is little hope that we will ever be free of war John Dear America If I have any quibble with Professor Howard it is that he says too little about civil war the real serpent in this Kantian paradise L ike all the best lecturers Howard does not get bogged down in detail the only numbers in the text are dates T he felicity of expression throughout is a delight Niall Ferguson Daily Telegraph A superbly crafted essay explaining why the West would be foolish to assume that permanent peace has come upon us This essay is a brilliant reflection on the world in which we live and the potential threats to it At root Sir Michael echoes the message of sensible statesmen and soldiers through the ages you never can tell Max Hastings Evening Standard T he book shows no signs of any lack of vigour or the quiet passion which has animated most of his work a passion for peace informed by an understanding that to build peace one has to understand war fully Christopher Coker RUSI Journal Howard thinks that

Michael Howard s The Invention of Peace is a brief book that surveys the evolution of war and peace War appears to be as old as mankind but peace is a modern invention Howard es th century jurist Henry Maine to begin the book It is this invention of peace and how it has been affected by the changing face of war that Howard focusses on Beside the introduction the book is divided into four parts examining ever smaller windows of history and the nature of war and peace in those times The first covers the period to the second goes up to the third to while the fourth looks simply at A D War was always messy expensive and easily got out of any sort of control But successfully waged war can bring great benefits including ridding one of pesky potential attackers War was and to a surprising or so Howard perhaps not so surprising extent still is commonplace Peace brings obvious benefits with it There is a lot to be said for the stability that peace allows including but not limited to the economic benefits of being able to better utilize limited resources rather than wasting them all on instruments of war Nevertheless the idea of peace is a relatively new one Howard suggests that if anyone could be said to have invented peace as more than a mere pious aspiration it was Kant Around the same time as this notion of peace began to spread wars also became more horrific Generally contained and limited before the French revolution not only loosened the purse strings but released manpower on a scale that made it possible to field large armies Following Napoleon there was a great incentive and an historic opportunity to achieve some sort of peace in Europe There was also a desire on the part of most of those involved to see to it that there was a balance of power that would help prevent further wars There were conflicting views as to how to go about this as Howard describes but a new order was established It made for a fairly successful peace lasting near a century with only a few European hiccoughs along the way After that came of course the Great War followed closely by another war to end all wars With the end of the Cold War where peace was held in the balance by the superpowers it remains to be seen whether the current order promotes peace or ultimately pushes us to war again The world has changed with one of the greatest changes being as Howard notes the erosion of the nation state Supranational entities and multinational firms wield increasing power And Howard maintains that many states that have become nations since have not developed as nations at all in part because they never had to go through that essential rite of passage of fighting for independence Howard suggests several threats to peace not the least of which is simple boredom Peace is artificial intricate and highly volatile he reminds the reader and the world does not seem up to entirely it Howard s book has a decidedly western focus a point he himself acknowledges Certainly the European and American wars of recent centuries have taken the greatest toll and had the most impact Nevertheless especially at this time small simmering regional conflicts seem the dominant forms of war from the former Yugoslavia to Chechnya to the myriad inter African conflicts that is where peace is at its weakest A bit more focus on this would have been of interest The Invention of Peace is a brief survey covering a lot of material fairly quickly Howard raises interesting points and he presents his arguments well but one does wish for more exposition as can be found in some of his other works It may not be an age for peace but apparently it is an age for concision Still a worthwhile little book Return to top of the page Links The Invention of Peace Profile Books publicity page Yale

training Tags Security Media Length Replies Views Jeremy W that blogging guy Tue Apr PM I agree completely Colleges are teaching a lot more about business priorities These are generally rooted in the convenience vs security balance but approached purely from a business sense Which is good but because the balanced isn t being maintained you have whole roles being defined around security which is good but again it s extreme because the balance is so far off jcfiala Self Portrait Tue Apr PM Huh never thought about it but yeah while I was at CMU admittedly ten years ago security was never brought up as something to worry about in any classes Now I m finding it rather facinating john murph Tue Apr PM You think you ve got it bad I finished my Computing degree nearly years ago I ve worked mostly for small companies on teeny dev teams ever since training is all about how good I am at picking stuff up as I go along If I were to disappear off at a tangent I know I should blog it there s a large group that s seldom well catered for Scoble was discussing how easy it is to blow one s conference budget a while back yet I exist in a world where the notion of conference budget doesn t even make it to the level of theoretical concept one does slightly better on training budget in that at least its acknowledged as not existing I feel better now vanlandw Wed Apr AM My college had an elective course System Security Tought with linux machines and pretty much we learned basic hacking techniques Then the second half of the course was implementing what we learned to a box and try to keep hackers out of our machines Very intersting to learn how a WHOIS and a HOST command can really screw up a machine adwb mm Wed Apr AM I know quite a few people who have been hired recently by Microsoft from WWU my current location of study and I happen to know that the security courses are few and far between Being a computer science student here at WWU has made me realize that this is not the place I want to continue my education The instructors don t seem interested in what they teach and the selection of courses is very focused on doing good math using a dated programming language I have to say that I have had one instructor who is very interested in security and writing quality code Coincidentally he teaches only one class per quarter and runs a local software company during the day I d go as far as to say he s not even a real professor So that reduces the number of excellent security instructors to nill at WWU nasserd Wed Apr PM My inaugural post to Channel hoorah I ve been on the software side of things for almost a decade now however only left college barely years ago From what I ve seen from the insides of schools public private ivy quasi ivy non ivy Tier and Tier whose curriculums I ve investigated here s a shortlist of their courses Whiz bang animation courses OOP using Java now more with C NET EE approaches to software dev t Starting a software biz n tier system how they work Very little has anything to do with security When the CS graduates look for jobs they say wait they can do that Or Naw that s not what I was taught Okay enough ramble Long story short students barely know what to look for and schools as always rely on student interests to build a popular field of study In the end as was previously mentioned since schools don t know what to offer and don t know who can teach it the students are unable to learn And the vicious cycle makes another round timothyblek bah Wed Apr PM My first poast as well I think alot of what is taught in schools comes from teaching to the lowest common denominator I participate on an advisory board every year at the local community college where I also teach part time This year I came across something interesting We basically ran into two schools of thought teach basic classes to get the high school kids up and running with computer and programming classes and on to a good year or jr programming job teach really cool but very advanced classes on security mostly network though knowing that we re going to be catering to businesses out there educating their employees though our certificate programs Obviously teaching Hello World isn t as sexy or fun as an advanced class on securing a Linux firewall so competent teachers want to have the fun courses Ultimately schools must make money though or they can t pay us teachers so the fresh meat get the basic programming classes not exciting at all mostly because it is a struggle to fill these student s heads with good programming practices and we spend a large portion of time just with flow control and the concepts of OOP That leaves the middle ground a sort of no man s land At what point is it appropriate to introduce a programmer to security concepts Before or after they learn what a switch statement is Before or after they learn to connect to a database Also look at the job postings today people are asking for things like a year of C years RDMS years OOP I have very rarely seen a request for something like year secure programming experience anduril Tue Jun PM I m not a programmer well not outside of being a hobbyist I enjoy doing some programming on the side in my free time so of course I m not going to be taught how to write secure code They re interested in attempting to pass a decent amount of us students who couldn t code if their lives depended on it Granted my school does offer quite a few security courses that don t focus on writing secure code but rather creating a secure system enviroment network what not I m an IST major not CS ryanlowe Wed Jun PM You will be happy to know that the Software Engineering program at the University of Ottawa has a required security course for all fourth year students It was quite comprehensive covering threat modelling encryption digital signatures I very much enjoyed going to the class and the content was very interesting I agree that generally developers are either ignorant or don t care enough about security issues though Ryan Lowe University of Ottawa Software Engineering class of lars Fri Jun AM Well looking just a few years back maybe Microsoft wasn t a company that took security seriously either As the demand for people with security training increases I m sure colleges will deliver Lars arun_coorg Arun World is Flat Friedman Sun Jun AM Hi College can teach some basic security aspects But it never teaches the real time stuffs I am doing Masters in Cybersec but when I go on with latest hacks and stuffs I find my study is nothing The latest technology threats are not at all included nor exposed in any university Microsoft might have not considered about security when they came into business or technology but they must provide information abt such things to the college which can be a part of study updating regularly Tranining is definately required when a grad student goes out of hos college Arun P H

Failing to Resonate With the British Public By Glenn Frankel Washington Post Foreign Service Wednesday April Page A NOTTINGHAM England Michael Howard was hammering home the need for more policemen on the beat before a television studio audience the other day in this city in central England where the rate of gun crime has soared in recent years The Conservative Party leader told the audience that his wife and daughter had been the victims of muggings in recent years and he cited statistics indicating fewer criminals were being caught than at any time in the past two decades What makes me really angry is the view that we have to settle for this Howard said It doesn t have to be like this Michael Howard the leader of Britain s Conservative Party is seeking to lead the Tories back into power after two consecutive landslide losses to Prime Minister Tony Blair and the Labor Party By Gareth Copley Associated Press Free E mail Newsletters Today s Headlines Columnists See a S le Sign Up Now Breaking News Alerts See a S le Sign Up Now But just as Howard was warming to his theme Glen Williams deputy chairman of the Nottingham Black Police Association interrupted He told Howard that his arguments on crime and immigration bordered on racism They are emotional and they are pandering to the basest fears of human nature scolded Williams who was in the studio audience Howard stuck to his view but his passion was clearly drained and he soon changed the subject It s been that kind of c aign for Howard who is seeking to lead his party back to power in Britain s election next week after two consecutive landslide defeats at the hands of Tony Blair and the Labor Party Every time Howard s tight disciplined and on target approach appears to be getting traction with British voters someone or something seems to come along to set him back again Under the guidance of Lynton Crosby a c aign manager who has steered Australia s conservatives to four successive victories Howard has kept to a script that has one slogan Are You Thinking What We re Thinking and just six c aign promises that can be boiled down to words lower taxes more police controlled immigration school discipline cleaner hospitals governmental accountability The party s manifesto only pages long once the excess white space is removed is its shortest since The back to basics platform appears custom made for two groups the party s right of center political base and undecided voters who feel uneasy about the direction of British society and want someone to blame Still the c aign lacks the ideological fervor that former prime minister Margaret Thatcher once brought to the hustings Conservatives no longer are arguing that they would cut the size of government but rather that they would run it more efficiently Public opinion polls suggest their case is not resonating with large numbers of voters Survey after survey shows the Conservatives a consistent to percentage points behind the Labor Party Though the Conservatives traditionally do to points better than the polls predict many analysts expect Blair to be returned to office albeit with a reduced parliamentary majority And the year old Conservative Party one of the most successful political organizations in the history of Western democracy is expected to go down to another defeat Analysts point to several reasons for the failure of the Tories as the Conservatives are commonly known Some blame Howard a year old former lawyer and political veteran who was a cabinet secretary in the days of Thatcher and another former prime minister John Major Howard is considered a steady but decidedly un charismatic candidate with a humorless prosecutorial public persona Years ago a fellow Conservative said there was something of the night about Howard a phrase that has stuck The c aign has also been criticized Some analysts contend that the Tories pared down agenda reads more like the shopping list of a party seeking to narrow the electoral gap rather than prepare for government And like Williams the police official some critics contend that the c aign smacks of a racist agenda especially the calls to reduce immigration Howard the son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe indignantly denies the racism charge But the rhetoric of some of the party s parliamentary candidates has fueled the allegation What bit of Send them back don t you understand Mr Blair demanded a leaflet for Bob Spink a Tory candidate who wants illegal immigrants summarily expelled Conservative strategists argue that their program appeals at a gut level to voters who might not be prepared to admit to pollsters that they are attracted to it CONTINUED Next Print This article E Mail This article RSS Feed Permission to Republish copy The Washington Post

age of sixteen he ran away from home and took up a new career in kickboxing He soon realized that he posessed eerie telekinetic abilities that allowed him to calculate a person s blood sugar level

probably disguised as your best friend Oddly enough Mr Stalin died soon after So much for betting his life We have fairly convincing evidence that he is in fact living among the Dimdii of Papua New Guinea After many years of quietly living amongst the Dimdii his insatiable desire for DIABOLICAL DOOM took over once again and he returned to the modern world incognito He changed his name to Illpalazzo and wore a very faggy outfit to hide his identity while he created alliances with Big Boss General Mills Space Pirates and other unmentionables He lead an effort to dominate the world and create a communist utopia in the year through a series of terrorist activities which set off the aptly named Demon Castle Wars of The Breakfast War The Console War The Super Robot War The Bankers War Class War X The Sequel War and many other sub wars After a series of victories the turning point came when Big Boss discovered he was actually working with Dracula freaked out and switched sides Things went downhill from there and Dracula was eventually apprehended by agents of CTU Japan and imprisoned In prison however he was roomed with a crack high man who repeatedly ass raped him in the showers This man later turned out to be Julius Belmont who claimed he ended Dracula s reign of terror after re hab This fucked up his ability to reincarnate every years and thus after dying in prison he lost sense of who he was and was re born as a teenager known as Soma Cruz with no memory of his former self Though he still has nightmares about the ass raping It is assumed that one day Dracula will return to his former self some day and return to the ways of communsism edit Fictional In the year scientists constructed the Superconducting Supercollider in an attempt to verify whether Dracula or everybody else is a fictional character Research is ongoing though progress is slow as most of the original team have been drained of blood and stuffed into the beamline It is a little known fact that Dracula revives every years and he teleports around a big fancy throne room while shooting fireballs from his crotch only to be whipped to death by some guy in a leather mini skirt Whether this is true or not is explored in the Cool Spot non video game series While popular rumor has it that the Castlevania series explores these stories that is not true see the Castlevania article for more

Howard Microsoft Security Engineering November Summary Michael Howard discusses how you can run as an administrator and access Internet data safely by dropping unnecessary administrative privileges when using any tool to access the Internet printed pages Download the DropMyRights msi file I ve said this many times but I ll say it again Running with an administrative account is dangerous to the health of your computer and your data So whenever someone says they must operate their computers as administrators I always try to persuade them it s not the correct thing to do from a security perspective That said every once in a while I meet someone who has a valid reason For ex le I use one of the computers in my office to install the latest daily build of Windows and I need to be an administrator to install the OS However and this is a big point I do not read e mail browse the Web or access the Internet in any form when running as an administrator on that machine And I do not do so because the Web is the source of most of the nasty attacks today What if someone does want to browse the Web Or read e mail Or do Instant Messaging and so on and for some reason must run in an administrative context If you look at the major threats to computers they are from user interaction with the Web through tools like browsers and e mail clients Sure there are non user interaction attacks such as Blaster http www cert org advisories CA html and Lion http www sans org y k lion htm but that s in part why we turned on the firewall in Windows XP SP Note For Best practices on running as a non admin I urge you to look over Aaron Margosis blog to glean tips on running as a non admin in Windows An Ex le of Why Running as an Admin Is Bad Some nasty malware works only because the user browsing the Web is an administrator A good ex le is a recent variation of the Bagle Beagle worm named W Beagle AV mm I would recommend you read up on what the worm does once it is invited onto a computer system Symantec has a good write up at http securityresponse symantec com avcenter venc data w beagle av mm html I say invited because the malware is not taking advantage of a coding or design defect It is using simple human error to execute Amongst the many things this malware does all of which require admin rights are Creating files in the system directory Terminating various processes Disabling the Windows Firewall Downloading and writing files to the system directory Deletes registry values in HKLM All these fail if the user running the e mail client is not an administrator So wouldn t it be useful read safer if you could browse the Web read e mail and so on as a non admin even though you need to perform your normal daily tasks as an admin Luckily Windows XP and Windows Server and later support this capability using restricted tokens Further Detail Windows XP and Windows Server and later support functionality called Software Restriction Policy also known as SAFER which allows a user or software developer to run code at a lower privilege without having the user enter credential information when the application starts For ex le an administrator could run an application as a normal user by stripping out certain SIDs and privileges from the application s token as the application is launched Some applications most notably Internet facing applications such as a Web browser instant messaging or e mail client should never be run under an administrative context The DropMyRights Application DropMyRights is a very simple application to help users who must run as an administrator run applications in a much safer context that of a non administrator It does this by taking the current user s token removing various privileges and SIDs from the token and then using that token to start another process such as Internet Explorer or Outlook This tool works just as well with Mozilla s Firefox Eudora or Lotus Notes e mail The code couldn t be simpler Here s the core code DWORD wmain int argc wchar_t argv DWORD fStatus ERROR_SUCCESS if argc argc Usage return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER get the SAFER level DWORD hSaferLevel SAFER_LEVELID_NORMALUSER if argc argv switch argv case C case c hSaferLevel SAFER_LEVELID_CONSTRAINED break case U case u hSaferLevel SAFER_LEVELID_UNTRUSTED break default hSaferLevel SAFER_LEVELID_NORMALUSER break get the command line and make sure it s not bogus wchar_t wszPath argv size_t cchLen if FAILED StringCchLength wszPath MAX_PATH cchLen return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER SAFER_LEVEL_HANDLE hAuthzLevel NULL if SaferCreateLevel SAFER_SCOPEID_USER hSaferLevel hAuthzLevel NULL Generate the restricted token we will use HANDLE hToken NULL if SaferComputeTokenFromLevel hAuthzLevel SAFER Level handle NULL NULL is current thread token hToken Target token No flags NULL Reserved STARTUPINFO si ZeroMemory si sizeof STARTUPINFO si cb sizeof STARTUPINFO si lpDesktop NULL Spin up the new process PROCESS_INFORMATION pi if CreateProcessAsUser hToken wszPath NULL NULL NULL FALSE CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE NULL NULL si pi CloseHandle pi hProcess CloseHandle pi hThread else fStatus GetLastError fwprintf stderr L CreateProcessAsUser failed lu n fStatus else fStatus GetLastError SaferCloseLevel hAuthzLevel else fStatus GetLastError return fStatus The source code and executable are available at the top of this article Now let s look at configuring the application to run applications in lower privilege Setup Simply copy DropMyRights exe to a folder Then for each application you want to run in lower privilege follow the steps in the next three sections Create a Shortcut Create a shortcut and enter DropMyRights exe as the target executable followed by the path to the application you want to execute in lower privilege For ex le C warez dropmyrights exe c program files internet explorer iexplore exe Figure shows what this will look like on your screen Figure Path to application that you want to run in lower privilege Updating the Shortcut Name Next update the name of the shortcut to represent the executable target and not dropmyrights I usually put the word Safer after the application name to denote this application will run in a safer security context Non admin is another common addition as shown in Figure Figure Updating the shortcut name Setting the Icon and Run Mode Finally once the shortcut is created set the Run option for the shortcut to Minimized and if you want select a new icon Figure Setting the Run option to Minimized and optionally changing the icon Advanced Options The arguments to DropMyRights are DropMyRights path N C U The meanings of the variables are Path is the full path of the application to launch N means run the application as a normal user This is the default if you provide no argument C means run the application as a constrained user U means run the application as an untrusted user Chances are this will cause some applications to fail The best way to identify what each of these settings does is to look at the resulting process token The following tables show the changes made to the process token Table Administrative Account SIDS Restricting SIDS Privileges DOMAIN Domain Users Everyone BUILTIN Administrators BUILTIN Users NT AUTHORITY INTERACTIVE NT AUTHORITY Authenticated Users LOCAL None SeChangeNotifyPrivilege SeSecurityPrivilege SeBackupPrivilege SeRestorePrivilege SeSystemtimePrivilege SeShutdownPrivilege SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege SeDebugPrivilege

AUTHORITY Authenticated Users LOCAL NT AUTHORITY RESTRICTED Everyone NT AUTHORITY INTERACTIVE NT AUTHORITY Authenticated Users BUILTIN Users SeChangeNotifyPrivilege The red cross mark means the SID is still in the token but it is a deny SID A SID with this attribute is a deny only SID When the system performs an access check it checks for access denied ACEs that apply to the SID but it ignores access allowed ACEs for the SID The biggest privilege and SIDs delta is between the administrative account and the normal user account As you can see all privileges are stripped from the token except the Bypass Traverse Checking privilege also know as SeChangeNotifyPrivilege Constrained and untrusted are smaller deltas from normal user and you may start to see some applications fail with security restriction errors My opinion is use Normal the default for most things and Constrained if you think you ll be browsing hostile or potentially dangerous Web sites Spot the Security Defect A good number of people worked out the bug in my last article The CreateFile function is opening the file for all access when the code only reads from the file FILE_ALL_ACCESS should be replaced with GENERIC_READ or similar This is bad because in all likelihood only an administrator can use this code not a normal user I see this error often Can you spot this code flaw This came across my desk the other day as a bug in some Java DNS stuff It s an interesting bug which I rewrote in C and generalized the flaw Int req while true getRequest req arr req DateTime Now Michael Howard is a Senior

Russian Personalities Product Reviews Tools Find a Job Online Degrees Yellow Pages Forums Most Popular Articles Latest Articles Help Full Product Review The Invention of Peace by Michael Howard Guide Rating The Invention of Peace is as the author notes early in his text an essay of around words the same size as the average MA dissertation Yet the term essay seems almost demeaning when describing a book which whether you agree with the analysis or not presents a marvelously incisive sweep of European History over years The work isn t a debate and the author doesn t examine the position of other modern commentators instead it s the author s own thoughts and conclusions laid out in a simple manner As the historian in question is the highly respected Michael Howard the thoughts and conclusions represent a lifetime of reading and rumination Readers may initially think the book s subtitle Reflections on War and International Order is deceptive despite an excellent introduction foreshadowing many later themes because much of the text is broader in subject matter Howard traces the many and changing roles of war alongside the evolution of European society and government showing how both have been responsible for conflict and order Moreover Howard doesn t just illustrate how conflict society economics politics and order are all intimately related for he also provides a brisk sweep through the development of Europe as a whole across a period which begins with Charlemagne and ends just before the War Against Terrorism I assume Howard is already working on a postscript to tackle this latter development Consequently The Invention of Peace is exhilarating to read as entire epochs of history pass by in a concise discussion that is sometimes witty sometimes sharp but always thought provoking This style does has its problems as Howard s descriptions are so stripped down he has risked distortion simply by using too few words All the clarifications and safety guards of modern historiography have been excised and if people wish to take issue with individual statements rather than the broader argument they may find plenty to argue about Of course that is also a point in the book s favour The Invention of Peace is both challenging and familiar In addition to the relationship between conflict and order Howard also reflects on the relevant theologies and ideologies as well as the emerging notion of peace making as good a case as any that Immanuel Kant was responsible for our modern understanding of the term Crucially Howard never preaches and he certainly never treats any of the philosophies or conflicts in anything other than the unbiased manner expected of all historians A basic knowledge of broader European history is helpful but not necessary in order to understand this book which further emphasis how well written it is and the argument swiftly flows past any specific events Equally Howard is as we would expect very well read and his book is full of references that the less experienced may not fully understand However and provided you don t mind doing so you can easily read past these incidents without damaging the book s impact although you may want to visit some learned friends afterwards Overall The Invention of Peace is an excellent rumination on the nature and interplay of war and order be it local or national social or economic The book isn t for everyone and it certainly isn t an introduction to European history as the content is more theoretical than practical more ideas than dates and Howard has written for an educated and intelligent audience who do their own thinking It is left quite rightly to the reader to digest the author s thoughts and form their own conclusions Indeed The Invention of Peace is essential reading not just for those interested in history but for anyone interested in modern and future world affairs The discussion on whether intervention in a state s internal affairs by a foreign power reinforces or erodes the balance of peace which occupies only two of the pages is still entirely relevant and growing more so by the day Related Guide Picks Related Resources Top Books Military Specific Top

August July June May April March February January December November October September August July May April March v v perfect co uk New New Labour website Main Iraqis elect socialists Two facts about Michael Howard UK Politics Conservative leader Michael Howard wants to tighten the laws to stop illegal immigrants entering Britain He is in a position to c aign for this because his grandfather entered Britain from Romania years ago illegally I ve heard the old insult about someone being willing to sell their own grandmother to get ahead but this is the first time I ve heard of someone willing to deport their own grandfather Conservative leader Michael Howard wants to introduce tougher laws on crime including ending the early release system When he was Home Secretary he released high level drug dealer John Haase from prison just months into an year sentence along with his associate Paul Bennett A member of Haase s gang Simon Bakerman imprisoned for running an hetamine factory is Michael Howard s cousin We re a very close family said Bakerman s mother Peter Gasston Saturday February comment Mr Howards ancestry is interesting perhaps if we looked more closely into the background of some of the many we seem to be welcoming with open arms Hamza etc this might be a safer place to live Perhaps we should all take a closer look at our ancestry we might not be so keen to knock back others The PM s father in law is a prime ex le of what we shoul all be aspiring to perhaps But hey were not electing him or Howard s grandad make your choice from what you have and chose the lesser liar with the smallest personal agenda John Saturday February link comment Why did Howard release two dangerous gangsters As the Tory leader calls for criminals to be kept behind bars police are investigating his role in a royal pardon for two men facing years in prison Robin Grant Sunday February link comment Drug dealer tried to call Howard as trial witness Nick Rigby Sunday February link comment And How many of the current Labour government enjoyed free state education and took part in peace movements only to later actually get into power try and trick the public into supporting war on a sovereign nation and then starting charging for access to higher education Politics is ugly full stop Brian Monday February link comment Michael Howard the Scouse GangLand Mister Big John Haase So what s NEW Haase was given the kid gloves treatment in virtually exactly the same fashion as a previous Liverpool Drugs Baron Curtis Warren And his Middlesbrough underling Brian Carrington In the early l s million was discovered in the property of used car dealer Charrington Whilst on remand in Strangeways Charrington was assisted in a move to a North East prison by the PPS to the then Attorney General In the event the authorities declined to prosecute Charrington But Warren was brought to trial Whereupon under cross examination he revealed that the million cocaine importation was bankrolled by the Security Service At which point the trial judge stopped the trial And directed the jury to acquit Warren SOURCE In The NAME of The LAW David Rose Vintage KillerFacts Tuesday February link comment Mr Howard wishes to withdraw from the Geneva Convention in Relation to the Treatment of Refugees Mr Howard wishes to set a a on the number of Asylum seekers that the UK can take leaving many in desperate need and in danger of death Mr Howard is selfish and without a conscience Anthony Silkoff Thursday February link comment Michael Howard is a shameless opportunist self important low life He thinks that by stirring up racial hatred among the British people he would be fit to form the next government He should remember that he is a Jew a minority class just like the other minorities The British have not given him the right to pretend that he appears to be the native Come the day that he would be treated as a minority when the British people open their eyes to his mischievous cunning ways to con them the votes Natan Friday February link comment Its a scandal that this issue concerning Howard s royal pardon for a drug dealer irrespective of Howard s family s involvement has not made the mainstream news Even if there is no suggestion of impropriety it raises massive questions about the competance of a politician who revels in his tough guy image and bleats endlessly about the early release of relatively minor offenders Yet again the Conservative press and other mainstream media not to mention the New Labour hierachy are completely unwilling to talk about the issue of organised drug related crime and politicians Remember the brief scandal concerning Lord Ashcroft the Tory peer who briefly made the headlines after the British High Commissioner for Belize wrote an open letter to the press doubting the credentials of this man for a peerage after one of his ships was seized by the US Drug Enforcement Agency Again nobody suggested Ashcroft was directly involved but under the circumstances isn t it the job of the media to ask questions in such cases Compare this non existent scrutiny of politicians to the obsessive reporting of David Blunkett s misdemeanours Sure Blunkett abused his position in a way that I m sure most politicians have at some stage or another but fast tracking a visa hardly compares to releasing a dangerous gangster less than a year into an year sentence Paul Krishnamurty Saturday February link comment I am a student and having labour as our government is very difficult Howard is a jew and we all know how jews think isreal killing innocent people even though i hate labour i would still vote for them over howard EDITORS NOTE we have left this comment in place in the interest of freedom of speech however please don t think the abhorrent racism expressed reflects anyone s beliefs apart from the commenter himself mughal Saturday March link comment Mughal your comment is truely disgraceful It is shocking to think that in people still hold such bigoted prejudices As well as bigotry your ignorance shines through from your inability to distinguish isreal from jews Anthony Monday March link

colin c bell Sunday April link comment there must be in the archives video footage of mr blair saying we will be tough on crime and the causes of crime Show on that video the day date and time when it was recorded Now produce a chart produced sequentially of ezzential crime statistics then and now This chart should I believe show that crime has worsened since mr blair took charge a background commentator could guide you through the chart and come to the inevitable conclusion that crime has got worse Now reshow the video clip and ask the viewer do you want to trust another five years of your life to this man The same could be cone for education education education taxation nhs etc In addition to the Iraq war mr blair has made enough pronouncements over the past eight years to totally

David Frum Posted Tuesday May ARTICLES National Post Canada Publication Date May Michael Howard the leader of the British Conservative Party is really a very fine man highly intelligent principled capable As Home Secretary in the last Conservative government he was a tough minded crime fighter Britain s answer to Rudy Giuliani Since he left office after the Conservative defeat in Britain generally and London especially have become dirtier less civil more dangerous Howard has a powerful personal story to tell as well Howard s parents arrived in Britain as refugees from the Holocaust He is the first Jew ever to head a major British political party Benjamin Disraeli had converted to Christianity at the age of And Howard is only the latest in a series of Conservative firsts The Conservatives were the first to choose a Catholic leader Iain Duncan Smith the first to choose a leader from a working class background Edward Heath and the first to choose a woman you know who Just by standing on the hustings Howard gives the lie to the shabby slur that the politics of inclusion is the politics of the Left But nobody is perfect The British election c aign that comes to a vote on Wednesday presented Michael Howard with a terrible temptation and when his party comes to look back on the events of they will realize that he did severe and lasting harm by succumbing The temptation was to play politics with the Iraq war Michael Howard voted in favor of the Blair government s war resolution in October as did a majority of his colleagues in the Conservative Party But over the ensuing months the war rapidly lost popularity in Britain and Prime Minister Tony Blair s personal credibility and his close relationship with U S President George W Bush emerged as the Labour Party s gravest points of political vulnerability And so through and Michael Howard step by step altered his once strong and clear views on Iraq In hopes of getting to Downing Street he used carefully coded language to try to reach out to war opponents without formally abandoning his still theoretically pro war position finally arriving at a position on the war so elaborately double embossed so intricately reverse chased that it defied human understanding In a July debate in the House of Commons Howard declared that if he had it to do all over again he would not have voted in favor of the October war motion but that he still supported the war nonetheless At various points over the past months he has accused Blair of dereliction of duty has demanded he resign and finally called him a liar outright At the same time Howard has said that he had many areas of agreement with the Prime Minister and has endorsed most of Blair s present policies When asked point blank what he would do in Iraq today Howard has simply changed the subject announcing that it is time to move on from the Iraq debate Many people have compared Howard s difficulties with Iraq to those of John Kerry But there is a big difference Over nearly two decades Kerry had established a record as one of the most dovish members of the U S Senate He opposed the Reagan defense buildup of the s opposed the struggle against communism in Central America and opposed the first Gulf War When Kerry voted in favor of America s war resolution in October few doubted that he was engaged in an act of political opportunism that he truly wanted to vote no but that he was afraid that a no might cost him the presidency as indeed his vote against the Gulf War had probably cost him a place as Bill Clinton s running mate in As Kerry moved to a more and more anti war position in he was moving closer and closer to his true self Howard by contrast is an instinctive hawk His October vote reflected his genuine views his move toward a more anti war position has been a move away from his true self It s hard to say which act of opportunism is morally worse Howard s or Kerry s Politically though I fear it is Howard s that will prove more damaging to his party Kerry did the Democrats one great service By attacking Bush on the war and losing so badly he discredited Vietnam era anti war politics probably for good Since November every would be president in the Democratic ranks has steered sharply to the right on national security and if the Democrats win in Kerry s negative ex le will deserve much of the credit Howard also will almost certainly lose But what message will Conservatives take away from the experience I very much fear that they will put the blame for their defeat not on Howard s maladroit opportunism but on his inner core of conviction I fear that next time they will go looking for a man who is all opportunism and given the state of today s Conservative Party they will have a wide range of choice Howard tragically arrived at the right answer only at the very end British voters in fact have moved on from the Iraq debate They were never going to vote out Tony Blair if they did not trust the Conservatives on health education and the economy And if the Conservatives could have regained that trust no opportunism on Iraq would have been needed in the first place David Frum is a

weighty matter it should not be taken lighty for nothing in politics is what it seems Thoughts on Education and C aign Finance By Michael Howard Nov th at pm EST Also listed in C aign Finance Reform A Government for the People America as a nation and America as a people face great challenges in the years ahead Those challenges and the way in which they are handled will determine not only our future but the future of the entire world Never in the course of human history has there been a global force as powerful politically socially and economically as the US is today For better or for worse many of the decisions made by the US government have global implications implications that reach far beyond our borders far beyond any Americans realm of experience and knowledge From the fight against AIDs on the ground in Africa to the global war on terror to corrupt governments in less developed nations to the growing global environmental crisis that threatens civilizations as a whole the actions and inactions of the US government are felt through out the world An Educated Population Leads to Good Government This is an awesome amount of power and the responsibility lies squarely at the feet of the American people No matter that few of us realize it our government governs with our consent and we by default consent to the way in which it governs The actions of the US government should reflect the needs and views of the people and it is the responsibility of the people to be educated enough on the issues to recognize real needs and form intelligent views an informed population controls government an uninformed population is controlled by government Those of who look at history with a critical eye have seen it time and time again and those who look at current events see it happening now North Korea and China with their state controlled media which attempts to suppress any news that might cast doubt on the motivations of their respective governments are prime ex les of governments keeping the population uninformed in an effort to control that population It is the duty of every American to at the very least educate themselves on the more important issues facing the nation and world It is the duty of the government to provide the population with avenues to higher education An uneducated population benefits only an oppressive government It is for this reason that increases in education spending is absolutely necessary Improved performance and opportunity at all levels of education from preschool to graduate school is vital to America s future and by default the future of the world Greater educational opportunity for all Americans should be a clearly stated and aggressively pursued goal of our government Not a talking point not a hollow promise trumpeted more loudly as Election Day draws near but an absolute national priority given full funding and the full attention of governing bodies at the local state and national level Our nation s education system is in crisis and again by default so is our nation s future and the future of the world as a whole Good Government Serves the Interests of the People The sooner the American population realizes that the fate of the world s population rests while not entirely but certainly disproportionately with us and our elected leaders the sooner we will begin to take this into consideration when choosing our leaders We must ask ourselves Whose interests are being served in Washington DC It is imperative that we the people see to it that it is our best interests being served that we are fairly competently and honestly represented Not the lobbyist and the interests that they represent not corporations like Bechtel and Halliburton for whom the Iraq war has been an unimaginable windfall with the bill being handed to the American taxpayer an unfathomable source of revenue The influence of Wall Street must be removed from Washington DC The business community and the general public have competing interests and what is good for one is not necessarily perhaps even rarely good for the other Politicians should not be businessmen and businessmen should not be politicians Among the ideas upon which America was founded was the separation of church and state There was good reason for this historically the union of church and state resulted in diminished freedom diminished rights and diminished opportunity for the general public The framers of our constitution were well aware of this fact however had they known that the influence of the business community on government would have resulted in the current climate of corruption and greed in which the interests of the American people take a backseat to the personal financial gain of elected officials and their business partners would they have included similar restrictions on business government relationships Again the influence of Wall Street must be removed from Washington DC The method and manner in which c aigns are financed must be drastically altered and new standards of ethics must be imposed upon those that seek political office When a corporation benefits from the actions of an elected official and then in turn that elected official benefits from the actions of that corporation the appearance of impropriety if not the fact are inescapable The business community and the government must be separated whenever and wherever they meet The opportunity for corruption the allure of ill gotten gains is too great and human nature is too fallible to leave our government and our future to promises of good judgment and altruistic motives When c aigns are financed by taxpayers when each c aign is given an equal amount of financial resources and outside funds are prohibited then and only then will the interests of the people of this nation be served If this requires an amendment to the constitution to strip corporations of what they deemed to be their right of free speech so be it If given the choice between a corporation s right to free speech and Americas right to a government that is free of corruption a government that will serve the interests of its people I can only think of one group that would side with the corporations and that would be the corporations themselves Our future the future of our nation and by default the future of the world rests in the hands of our elected officials and being that it is our vote that elects those officials I ask you this question What is your responsibility Mail to a Friend Link Comments The But that is defining America By Michael Howard Nov nd at pm EST Also listed in C aign Finance Reform A Government for the People I can always hear a but coming in a speech in a news report even in casual conversation I can even hear the unspoken but s the implied but s I cannot believe that such a talent is genetic but my father was very much the same I could not watch a movie with him he always without fail knew the ending long before the plot began to wind down He was forever anticipating forever futuring into the storyline In my experience he was never wrong Unlike me he was not overly political Having been born in and raised in an era where the media was a completely and totally different beast He died during Clintons first term before the true nature of the beast was to be revealed I wonder though if he saw that coming I would like to think that he did But I can always see a but coming even when one is hiding and they often hide For Instance The Federal Election C aign Act prohibits corporations and labor organizations from using their general treasury funds to make contributions or expenditures in connection with federal elections In spite of this broad prohibition there are many ways in which a corporation or labor union my legally participate in federal election activities So says the FECs C aign Guide There is no but in there but the but is clear as day If In spite of and but are not interchangeable in this instance stop reading now because the rest of this will not make any sense to you According to dictionary com my preference in linguistic reference material the phrase in spite of can be defined as in disregard or defiance of notwithstanding Rarely does one see a more accurate usage of a colloquialism then in the above legalese The in spite of above refers of course to SSFs separate segregated funds or PACs Political Action Committees are funny things and I am not sure that Mr and Mrs America really know what they are and what they do They are a product of the but hidden in the FECs opening statement as noted above Apparently corporations like Comcast Verizon and AT T cannot involve themselves in c aign finance but the Comcast Political Action Committee the AT T Inc Federal Political Action Committee and the Verizon Communication Inc Good Govt Club can Maybe I am not as sophisticated as many of those that dwell in the Hall of Power but I would greatly appreciate some clarification on this because I am not seeing the distinction I consulted dictionary com and wikipedia to no avail I will lay that bit of confusion aside and reach for another One might think that a PAC would have a discernable political agenda As it turns out believe it or not this is not necessarily the case In an effort to ascertain an overt political agenda let us consider the three behemoths mentioned above and how they have exercised the FECs but In the c aign cycle Comcasts PAC donated to a total of to congressional candidates Democrats and Republicans AT Ts PAC donated a total of to candidates Democrats and Republicans Finally Verizons PAC donated a total of for candidates Democrats and Republicans Clearly neither Comcast Verizon nor AT T recognize party lines Now I have always been under the assumption that party lines and politics go hand in hand Apparently the giants of the telecommunications industry are more interested in fair play then party lines A level playing field in the game of politics Again I might not be as sophisticated as some but I just cannot believe that If that were the case why not just keep your money and build a park or two Maybe lower your service rates a few pennies The truth is that nobody spends a dime unless they think they are getting a dime s worth of something in return preferably a quarters worth but good luck with that one So obviously Comcast Verizon AT T and all other PACs feel they are getting something for their money and that something is access They care nothing for party lines and therefore nothing about politics they care only about geographic lines those lines that encompass Washington DC While candidates are voted into office by the people they do not become candidates without financing The big picture indicates that big business picks the candidate and leaves the election in our hands We get to choose which one of their guys gets to the capitol The money matters more then the vote What is my effort and my vote worth when faced with the millions of dollars that these corporate PACs can throw behind a hand picked candidate This American style Democracy has no future It is up to the party of the people to change this and it looks like the party of the people will wrest a measure of control away from the GOP in the coming weeks Do we put it out of our misery now and work towards publicly funded c aigns

Americas Issue February Offline Michael Howard Principal analyst and co founder Infonetics Research by Ted McKenna Sun February Living in the San Francisco Bay area in the s and s Infonetics Research principal analyst and co founder Michael Howard got to see the emergence of the free speech movement first hand So the question is did he wear tie dyed clothing and have long hair Oh sure I was a programmer and the programmers that I worked with we were the hippie types Howard says The engineers were more likely to wear the ties to work Michael Howard Title Principal analyst and co founder Infonetics Research Age Resides Santa Rosa Calif Length at Current Position Years Education B S in Mathematics University of California at Berkeley After his graduation from UC Berkeley Howard helped develop operating systems and programming language compilers for Arpanet though he didn t know that Arpanet would evolve into the global phenomenon called the Internet At the time I thought it was amazing that all these different kinds of computers could talk to one another and that scientists and researchers could talk with one another Howard says It was all absolutely fascinating but there was no way I imagined it was going to become what it is Still a resident of northern California Howard says he enjoys diving on the weekends for abalone a single valve mollusk that can be found attached to the rocks near shore at low tide The meat is delicate and tasty and so good You re allowed to collect three a day and up to a year and from three abalone you can get something like a pound or two of meat Howard says After I get a couple of hours in the water I end up feeling as refreshed as if I had spent a couple of days in the mountains Looking back too much money was invested in the telecom industry Did you know that at the time No I was caught up in it Everything that people were thinking was going to happen will happen it s just that it hasn t happened as quickly as we thought We continue to see a doubling or tripling of Internet traffic every year It may not be every days like it used to be but there s still a lot of growth For one thing there s video coming people will be able to get it as easily over their phones as on their TV at some point At times some analyst firms have seemed partial to publishing hockey stick shaped charts predicting massive growth in various industry segments Were you ever guilty of that I think one of the things Infonetics has always done is be more conservative in its predictions We don t just listen to manufacturers or carriers We try to find out who is buying what from manufacturers and we check with manufacturers to see what they ve actually shipped so that we can come up with realistic estimates Is the management corruption uncovered lately at some telecom companies a reflection of the industry or simply a sign of the times I saw a e from management consultant Peter Drucker a year or so ago that four times in the past years we ve seen the pendulum swing back and forth between governments getting too lax on corporations corporations taking advantage as a result and the government getting tougher again Right now I think you could say the pendulum is swinging back Certainly technology is changing the social fabric of the world and when it s a time for entering new territory the rules haven t really been written about how people should act and so companies naturally take advantage Telecom helps make possible the outsourcing of jobs like software development to countries outside the U S Do you think that s bad or good I think economies just have to adjust A lot of people like to use the ex le of railroads in the s It was a disruptive technology and it allowed communications to a better extent in that the mails were carried more quickly and goods were more easily transported and that changed the social order Telecom isn t moving actual goods but it s moving information which is along the same lines and
