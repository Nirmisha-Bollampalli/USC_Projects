Developer uses new technology to protect oak trees during construction Environmentally conscious property developer Michael Howard Homes is pulling out all the stops to ensure that two mature holm oak trees are protected during the construction of a luxury four bedroom house in the village of Holbrook The Dedham based developer has called in a specialist team of tree experts to carry out advanced new tree treatments using the very latest in technology to protect the roots of the holm oaks quercus ilex during the construction of a driveway to the new property which is due to be completed in the summer Mike Dewhurst from Eastwood Tree Services in Coddenham said Taking the driveway over the root system of the trees is normally detrimental to the structure of the roots but with new technology and materials the damaging effect can be dramatically reduced We will be feeding the root system by injecting into it special products that will develop the root system to become more efficient in extracting water and nutrients from the soil thus enabling the trees to overcome the stress of the new entrance The root system of a mature tree can extend between one and two times the height and spread of the tree The main feeding roots of a tree are located within the first mm of the soil level so any compaction or soil removed will cause damage without specialist equipment being used We will be using a special air spade that allows us to excavate within the root system without any long term damage to the health of the tree added Mike Dewhurst This is cutting edge tree care and our staff our fully trained in this new approach and we are specialists in this field Builders are not normally sympathetic to trees and Michael Howard Home s taking the trouble and expense to protect these holm oaks is an excellent ex le of a professional builder working with a professional tree company The driveway being installed over the root system will spread the weight of the vehicles by means of a very strong mesh allowing the weight to be spread over the roots It will be constructed of a porous material enabling the water to percolate into the root system and air and gases to be exchanged Adrian Mann left Construction Director Michael Howard Homes and Michael Dewhurst MD Eastwood Tree Services inspecting Holm Oak tree in Holbrook Pruning of Holm Oak and aerating soil without damaging vital root system Michael Howard Homes is experienced in building in conservation areas and builds properties with empathy for the area in which it is developing The protection of the environment in which we build is of great importance to us and we will invest wherever possible in the necessary support and services to enable us to maintain the environment during construction said Michael Howard Homes construction director Adrian Mann Eastwood Tree Services was the obvious choice for this project as its staff are experienced and highly trained in this unusual field This is an expensive operation but we believe it is more than worth it to protect these beautiful old trees The holm oaks will be monitored over the next two years to make sure they retain their beauty in the village The new property Holm Oaks will be completed in August It is set on a secluded plot in the heart of Holbrook and will be of brick and tile construction using reclaimed roof tiles Michael

has been cleaned up by local property developer Michael Howard Homes and work has begun on building a brand new million plus luxury home on the site The land the site of the old gas works in Mill Lane was so contaminated that it had become potentially harmful to the environment Michael Howard Homes demolished former The Mallard restaurant on the site and cleared some tonnes of contaminated waste from the area to make it safe and suitable for development This was a very difficult and hugely expensive clean up operation due to the extent of the contamination and the fact that the site is close to a river said Adrian Mann construction director of Dedham based Michael Howard Homes Michael Howard Homes consulted closely with Colchester Borough Council planners and the Dedham Vale Society to produced agreed plans for the new property Millstream House which will be a five bedroom house featuring a four car lodge and bottle wine cellar It will be built using traditional methods and incorporating locally reclaimed materials The company is used to building on brownfield sites in conservation areas and builds properties with empathy for the area in which it is developing Mr Mann
