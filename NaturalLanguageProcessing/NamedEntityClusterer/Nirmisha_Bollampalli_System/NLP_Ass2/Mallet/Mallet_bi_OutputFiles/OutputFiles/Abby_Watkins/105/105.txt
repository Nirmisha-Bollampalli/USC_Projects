YOSEMITE The Big Walls El Capitan Half Dome North American Ice Colorado South America ARGENTINA PATAGONIA Last season brought a number of new routes and important ascents completed by parties travelling in a light and fast style Unfortunately one of the significant factors influencing parties to climb in this style was the season s abysmal weather Throughout October and November the Patagonian climate was as bad or worse than that seen in the past by many of the regular aficionados Some good spells occurred in early December and there were occasional fine days later but by the New Year things had gone dramatically downhill The snowfall increased to such an extent that the local population were shaking their heads and saying that they had not seen so much snow in the austral summer for more than years Not surprisingly there was noticeable strain amongst climbers based on the C o de Agostini formally the C o Bridwell as continuous bad weather led to many unaccomplished dreams Several visitors this year have been critical of the growing trend to claim routes which end far from the summit Some of these join other existing routes and others don t even get that far On the peaks of Patagonia it is generally the last few hundred metres that are unique As one of the protagonists put it the hardest metre in Patagonia is the last metre as you have to get there to climb it This is particularly true in the normally hostile environment of a region where a few extra hours in the face of an advancing storm can be some of the most terrifying in a climber s career It may be time once again to look at what constitutes or not a first ascent Cerro Pollone Italians Luigi Crippa and Lorenzo Nadali climbed a new route on the South East Face of this m peak northeast of Piergiorgio on the th October This was the first route to be completed in the Chalten region during the season Towards the end of Nadali with Mauro Giriadi and Andrea Sarchi completed Ensueno on the North West Buttress of Fitzroy to the right of the Supercanaleta and had a clear view of Cerro Pollone opposite It was at this time that Nadali saw a couloir splitting the triangular lower buttress of the face and resolved to go back and try it Crippa who is very good on ice numerous hard winter ascents and ice climbs in the Dolomites as well as incidentally a number of mixed routes on Ben Nevis seemed a suitable partner and the pair spent a week waiting for good weather before crossing the Passo Quadrado on the th October After sleeping for three hours they continued to the Passo dell Hombre Sentado close to the start of the climb The ice in the couloir was perfect and the lower four pitches went easily They then entered a section hidden from the base of the climb where the ice runnel narrowed to cm and on occasions was no more than cm wide and sometimes cm thick Above the rock pyramid at about half height on the face the route crossed much easier ground to the west before starting up the left flank of the final ridge The pitches were thinly iced and one required some aid but conditions were amazingly good allowing the pair to progress up thin terrain so thin they felt that were a similar situation to be found in their homeland it would be impossible for them to make any upward progress The last pitch was particularly run out and the pair reached the top one report states that the actual summit was not reached in fine weather and light winds Descent was made by rappel five in total following the upper half of the route and then by down climbing the glacier slopes behind the initial rock pyramid to reach their c on the th The new route christened Mastica e Sputa Chew and Spit was m long and given an overall alpine grade of ED sections of see topo A French pair female climber Laurence Bonoyer and Bruno Sourzac made the second ascent on the th December Piergiorgio In November December Italians Maurizio Giordani and Gian Luca R ikino Maspes attempted a new route up the middle of the North West Face Gringos Locos has pitches up to a and A but was terminated well short of the summit see INFOS and and the ropes left in place for a subsequent attempt That attempt was due to take place last December but when the pair arrived back at the base of the wall they found their fixed ropes shredded despite having taken stringent measures to tension them down Unwilling to go through the whole operation again they turned their attentions to a suitable alternative the unclimbed North East Ridge which forms the left skyline of the photos published in INFOS and Three difficult pitches led to the col between the Piergiorgio and Cerro Pollone where the pair bivouacked on the night of the th December The following day they moved on to the south flank and climbed m of mixed ground rock to a and A and ice to WI to reach the huge summit mushroom which is supposedly unclimbable The route was christened Esperando la Cumbre The North West Face was the scene of a brief attempt on a new route by the French team of St eacute phane Benoist St eacute phane Gauard Pierre Menats and J eacute r ocirc me Thini egrave res These four only managed to climb three pitches and reportedly drilled holes for bat hooks and rivets in only m of climbing before a fall to Gauard which injured his shoulder and leg forced the entire team to retreat and concentrate on evacuating the casualty Aguja Bifida Two new routes were climbed on this m doubled headed summit which lies on the ridge immediately north of Stanhardt The strong Italian team of Paolo Cavagnetto Roberto Giovannetto Manlio Motto Gianni Predan and Cesare Ravaschietto arrived in the region during December and hauled gear over the Passo Marconi and on to the Hielo Continental Although they had no fixed objective except to climb in the remote wilderness side of the range they chose the West Face of Bifida as it still had no lines at that date and other faces in the vicinity looked rather too dangerous The most well known member of the team Manlio Motto is undoubtedly one of the most prolific Alpine rock climbers in Italy He has created over routes mostly from the ground up and with high standard obligatory moves He is particularly noted for his wide use of bolts on the virgin compact rock of the Mont Blanc Massif and his numerous new routes throughout this region have been widely reported in these pages The most compelling line on the Bifida was an obvious diedre which rose to a notch just left of the main or North Summit not reached from any direction until when an Argentinian Swiss duo Bresba and L uuml thi climbed the North East Face a and A on mediocre rock Using fixed ropes on part of the route the Italians climbed the pitch line to the summit on the th th and th th of December The rock was found to be extremely good and the climbing marvellous Apart from the stances which were fully bolted one bolt and half a dozen pegs were used with the main source of protection coming from wires and Camalots up to No The climbing was mixed free and aid with difficulties up to b and A Italian and certain other Continental aid grades appear to be different from those widely used in the USA The rating depends entirely on the difficulty of the moves and not the fall potential The route was christened Hielo y Fuego given an overall Alpine grade of ED see topo and all members summited As the weather remained good the team decided to try another line up the pillar leading to the northerly foresummit more or less an independent summit This they completed from the th th with a bivouac at the top of the seventh pitch This pitch route christened Su Patagunia was again on superb and very abrasive rock though the climbing was perhaps not of the same high quality as Hielo y Fuego The climb finished on the crest of the ridge facing the Quatro Dedos and had maximum difficulties of b one short section of A Belays were again equipped and three extra bolts placed for protection On the th the weather turned for the worse and the team evacuated via Piedra del Fraile to Chalten They note that on this wild side of the range Hielo y Fuego is one of the few routes completed that actually reaches the summit ex les of those that don t include Gracias a la Vida on Punta Herron Cristalli nell Vento on Cerro Torre and Pepe Rayo on Piergiorgio Cerro Stanhardt The Anker Gerberding line of Tomahawk a direct start to Exocet up the lower wall of the East Face received its fourth ascent on the th January by the talented Spanish climber Simon Elias and fellow countryman Josu Merino The m ED route was found to give ice climbing up to and rock to and A as opposed to the a and A rating given by the French who made the second and third ascents The Spaniards had the assistance on the first two pitches of fixed ropes established by another party and climbed the route to within one pitch of the Exocet gully Cerro Torre Only one ascent was recorded of this prestigious mountain during the season and this proved to be the first complete ascent of the peak since the season Spanish climbers Simon Elias and Josu Merino reached the top on the th February having made the sixth ascent of Casimiro Ferrari s route on the West Face The Spaniards spent many hours climbing and digging through the m summit mushroom which turned out to be the most difficult and dangerous pitch of the entire route Several years ago during a filming operation which involved landing a helicopter on the highest point of the Torre a huge cave was dug in the top of the mushroom to accommodate the film crew and the entrance closed off with a door It appears that the hole must have caused a significant weakening in the structure and some time later the mushroom keeled over and from all directions presented a formidable challenge In the last few years parties have avoided climbing this last difficult pitch considering it either not important or impossible Later in the season veterans Maurizio Giarolli and Elio Orlando climbed nine pitches up a new route on the Torre but could not finish it due to the abysmal weather They left it fixed and plan to return this October Not surprisingly details of the exact line of the attempt are being withheld Aguja Guillaumet The Valtellina based climber Gian Luca R ikino Maspes made a solo ascent of the Argentinian Route with the variation by Maurizio Giordani who also climbed solo in just five hours on the th December This m line on the North West Face has difficulties up to a b and A Maspes used a backrope on only one pitch The Argentinian Route Comesa ntilde a Fonrouge and A although the original line to the summit of this m rock tower north of Fitzroy has not become the standard route that honour now reserved for the Brenner Moschini route on the North East Ridge and A However last season it appears the original route was repeated on several occasions as were the French Couloirs on the East Face Coquenoit Guillot and Amy Vidailhet climbed in Aguja Mermoz On the th December Giordani teamed up with Aldo Leviti a highly noted Dolomite climber with many elegant new routes to his credit to climb a new line on the North West Face to the right of the Argentinian Route North West Pillar Cuinas Vieiro m pitches Their line which was more or less m long climbed for pitches up the face to join the Argentinian Route on the summit ridge and had difficulties of c with a short section of A The summit m northeast of Fitzroy was not reached and the climb achieved in a continuous effort of hours from Base C to Base C Leviti has prefixed a number of his Dolomite test pieces with the name Iper e g Iperscotoni on the Cima Scotoni and therefore it was no surprise to find this Patagonian route christened Iper Mermoz Aguja Poincenot Only one ascent has so far been reported of this m summit south of Fitzroy and this was a new route from the American team of Greg Crouch and Jim Donini On the th and th December immediately after their climb on Rafael see below the pair set off for the North Face approached as for the Carrington Rouse Route on the West Face then continuing for a total of m of mixed ground to the base of the wall at the same point as the West North West Pillar first climbed in at a and A pitches by the Italian team of Bosisio Panzeri Della Santa and Vitali The arrival of a storm caught the Americans halfway up the face on the th and although they sat it out for the next two nights their food ran out and they were forced to retreat to a high c on the th A day later the weather improved and they set off again spending the night at the top of the fourth pitch and climbing the remaining the following day to the shoulder The difficulties thus far were rated and A and included hard off widths and tight chimneys see topo From this point the end of the difficulties the pair tired from seven days of continuous action continued for another three hours of pitching scrambling and intricate route finding to get to the summit By sunrise the following morning they were back at their bivouac ledge and after a few hours rest continued down to their c having left virtually their entire rack of rappel anchors but well pleased at having persevered to the true summit They named the climb The Old Smuggler s Route after the Argentinian whisky that kept them going through the times of bad weather For Donini this was another superb achievement coming after his new route in Alaska last year with Crouch see INFO years after his historic first ascent with Bragg and Wilson of neighbouring Torre Egger Fitzroy The first route to be completed during the season on Fitzroy was the Supercanaleta Supercouloir the m gash on the North West Face originally climbed in during the second ascent of the peak by Argentinians Comesana and Fonrouge The French pair Pierre Mahenc and Jean Philippe Tremblai despatched the route in two days over the nd rd of December There were short sections of ice and some rock at a The first ascent of the couloir was an impressive achievement for the era by climbers who were completely unknown outside of their own country The route resisted a second ascent until The standard route up the South East Pillar Franco Argentinian pitches normally climbed at b and A followed by mixed climbing up the summit ridge was climbed by a six man Russian team which spent days on the route summiting on the st February In January an Italian team from Trieste Carlo Bormolini Massimo Boni Mauro Petronio Angelo Pozzi Mauro Rontini and Marco Sterni climbed the huge North Diedre to give Tehuelche This m and pitch route was climbed in a final push of seven days It was mostly free up to a but with a short section of b and some A and A The team reported joining the French Route on the North Face less than m from the summit at which point they terminated their ascent in high winds and rappelled the route The Argentinian climber Rolando Garibotti now resident in Colorado had dreamed of making an Alpine style ascent of this route ever since copying the original topo at the park headquarters when a teenager of Last December he teamed up with American Doug Byerly to do just that The pair completed the climb in a hours push over the th th but found that the point where the Italians had stopped was some m from the summit the first three pitches of which still involved tricky mixed ground Byerly and Garibotti s first integral ascent of the route used no fixed ropes though the pair were dismayed to find the line completely littered with gear from the first ascensionists The Italians had apparently fixed the entire route and left m of rope in place Byerly and Garibotti cut away nearly of the years old decaying material and threw it down to the glacier together with a sack full of rotting clothing left on a stance They started out from a high c at am on the th in perfect weather but first had to ascend the Sitting Man Ridge a climb in itself with around m of moderate ice and sections of mixed terrain Climbing unroped they reached the top of this ridge in three hours and started up Tehuelche at am finding extremely enjoyable climbing and some of the best granite that either had ever touched On the first day they climbed with quite heavy packs containing bivouac gear and food for three days After pitches some of which were wet or icy they reached a big ledge called the Grand Hotel and stopped for the night Although it clouded over that evening the next day dawned fine and the pair continued up the Diedre de Marco named after Marco Sterni the star Italian rock climber who led the entire feature This gave the hardest climbing on the route and was often difficult to protect due to the off width nature of the cracks As the day continued warm the upper pitches became increasingly wet and the finish involved an A section up a now gushing waterfall Several pitches of climbing still in rock boots above the point where the Italians turned back led to easier mixed ground and eventually the true summit a thin blade of granite The weather remained stable and the pair made it back to the Grand Hotel that night for a few hours sleep before continuing down to the foot of the wall just hours after starting out The line which they comment involves some great free climbing was completed at b and A see topo Aguja Rafael Inominata Doug Byerly and Rolando Garibotti made the fourth ascent of the original Anglo American Route via the West Face and South Ridge Boysen Braithwaite Dickenson Reid USA Sylvester USA a on the nd December This gives m of splendid and sustained climbing and was the second time Garibotti had climbed the route he made the third ascent in with American Charlie Fowler This time the pair climbed a new four pitch variation to give the route an overall technical grade of b and A On the same day Americans Greg Crouch and Jim Donini attempted the first ascent of the West Ridge hoping the route would go easily in the day as a warm up for the season it didn t After pitches of difficult mixed climbing and rather convoluted route finding plus a bitterly cold open bivouac they joined the Anglo American route at the notch some six pitches short of the summit Unable to continue above this point due to sheer exhaustion and dehydration the pair retreated The line had difficulties of and A plus ice mixed to but because of their commendably high ethical standards where any Alpine route is not completed unless the summit is reached the pair do not consider this a new route though many current Patagonian activists might and have declined to name it Rather it simply felt like we had gotten our butts kicked by one of the smallest peaks in the range Aguja St Exup eacute ry South of Rafael this m rock tower received at least three ascents last season two from Garibotti The day after their ascent of Rafael Byerly and Garibotti headed back up for an attempt on the Giordani Valentini line Chiaro di Luna on the m high West Face However due to very cold conditions the pair could not start the climb until midday and then were forced to use aid on the initial cracks which were very iced Once they moved on to better rock conditions they speeded up and managed to reach the summit in hours just before dark after a total of pitches up to c Rappelling through the dark the rope jammed at around am and the pair sat out a very cold night before easily freeing the offending rope in the daylight and continuing safely down to their c the following morning Around on the East Face two members of a Russian team climbed the superb m East Pillar used to make the first ascent of the tower in by the Italian team of Buscaini Condot Metzeltin Romano and Sinigoi m and A climbed all free at c except for one short aid section by Schwitter and Ishibe in The pair reached the summit on the th December One day later during a hours period of good weather after a long spell of bad Garibotti moving light and fast managed to solo the Harrington Kearney Route m a on the North West Face Due to the previous poor weather the conditions were icy which made the climbing slow as each hold had to be checked for verglas Even so Garibotti climbed mostly unroped self belaying only a few sections and reached the top in fours hours He was back at c for afternoon tea Aguja de la S In addition to the climbs reported in INFO Pablo Besser and the Argentinian Gadi Slomka repeated the Austrian Route B auml rnthaler Lidi on the East Face of the Aguja de la S m one of the smallest granite peaks on the main ridge several kilometres south of Fitzroy From a bivouac at the edge of the glacier above the Rio Blanco Base C the pair made their ascent on the th February in excellent weather climbing first three snow pitches at c and then the rock pitches above at b and A The rock section follows a prominent diedre offering predominantly wide cracks in excellent granite The climbers replaced all the rappel anchors on their descent It is perhaps interesting to note that Hans B auml rnthaler who made the first ascent of this route and was active in both Patagonia and the Himalaya in the late s routes include a first ascent on Aguja St Exup eacute ry plus the Voie Normales on Cho Oyu and Xixabangma Main Summit was tragically killed in on the Austrian K East Face expedition Bad weather prevented the team from making much progress and while B auml rnthaler was climbing a small peak on the opposite side of the glacier in order to take photographs of the face he was swept away by a windslab avalanche El Mocho The squat rock tower at the foot of the South East Ridge of Cerro Torre received at least four ascents during the season The French duo Bonoyer and Sourzac with fellow countrymen Pierre Mahenc and Jean Philippe Tremblai made an ascent of the Central Ice Gully climbed in by Grassi Pe and Rossi and christened All or Nothing but often referred to as the Grassi Goulotte The two French pairs climbed the m TD route up the East Face on the th November Later on the th December Byerly and Garibotti attempted this line but found it too dangerous as a result of the recent warm weather On the th December the Swiss pair Denis Burdet and Jean Zweiacker made a relatively early repeat of the Anker Piola route Voie des B eacute nitiers on the South Pillar this route had its second ascent on the st December This m route pitches on the pillar followed by the summit ridge was originally graded F c and A b obl though is now considered c and A The route was climbed again on the th January by Rolando Garibotti and Gian Luca Maspes Cerro Marconi Norte Maurizio Giordani climbed a new route solo on the north flank of this peak above the Passo Marconi on the th December The m line had maximum difficulties of PUNA DE ATACAMA The highest peaks in Chile and also those in Argentina apart from Aconcagua lie near the southern limits of the Atacama Desert and are rarely visited due to the extreme isolation and lack of water The Atacama is commonly considered the world s driest desert area There has been a long debate as to whether Pissis or Ojos del Salado the latter often referred to as the highest active volcano in the world is the second highest summit in the Americas after Aconcagua Recent accurate Argentinian surveys give the benefit of the doubt to Pissis and the Argentine IGM sheet III at the only accurate topographical map in existence to feature both summits now marks Ojos as m and Pissis at m There may of course be a little political skulduggery there as Ojos lies on the border with Chile whereas Pissis is entirely within Argentina Any controversy may well be eliminated after August when Mike Jenkins takes his team of British Military Surveyors from the Royal Engineers to climb Ojos together with a group of like minded Chilean surveyors In Jenkins and his team climbed Chimborazo and made a complex differential GPS survey of the mountain arriving at an altitude of m some m or so lower than the long accepted height The Ecuadorians were so impressed with this technique that they now use the new height on all their official maps see INFO The Argentinians used identical techniques to come up with the height of m for Pissis in see INFO but Ojos has yet to have any such treatment and may yet prove the higher mountain Jenkins compares today s military surveyors to the old Survey of India team who first explored many of Asia s high peaks in the last century Names such as George Everest Colonel Montgomerie and Kenneth Mason ensure a proud tradition of military surveyors and one which still compels the modern day descendants to travel to unknown lands In October November three British mountaineers Gordon and John Biggar plus Richard Wilkins made some interesting first British ascents in the region including Pissis The team approached the largely snowless mountains from the village of Fiambala in Northern Argentina and first made an ascent of the very rarely climbed Cazadero m which lies to the southwest of Ojos and is also known as Walther Penck The volcano was originally climbed by Japanese in and only appears to have received one ascent since by a group from Chile in The British team climbed the easy northern slopes All three then made an ascent of the Argentinian side of Ojos del Salado reaching the summit on a cold and windy st October The group then transferred the km south to Pissis and made the ascent on the th November via the North Glacier from a high c at m Those final c m took only six hours in near perfect weather a particularly notable achievement for Gordon Biggar and Wilkins aged and respectively Pissis was first climbed by the Poles in with a second ascent not recorded until Two Americans Kent Pierce and Stuart Richie who reached the top on the th February this year at the end of a days stint in which they climbed all three highest summits in South America Pissis reached by a remote cross country drive involving an unauthorized border crossing in to Argentina found the summit register to contain entries for less than ascents since This lack of attention may soon change if the label second highest peak in the Americas is widely accepted Most ascents appear to have been made either by very small parties or solo John Biggar who has made ascents of over of the highest peaks in the Andes and is the author of the recent publication The High Andes A Guide for Climbers went on to solo three more of the volcanoes Olivares m Majadita m much further south of Pissis and Nacimiento del Jague m The latter is a subsidiary summit of Nacimiento m immediately south of Cazadero and was possibly unclimbed before this ascent CHILE Hielo Patagonico Sur Following our brief report in INFO on the Arved Fuchs Expedition to cross the Hielo Patagonico Sur the Southern Patagonian Ice Cap and explore the Falla de Reichert we can now give more details on the climbing that took place on the Ice Cap to the east of the Fiordo Peel Fuchs perhaps best known for his Trans Antarctic crossing with Messner in and his claim to be the first man to walk to both North and South Poles within months had sailed from Canada in his yacht Dagmar Aaen with a crew of Germans one Alaskan and one Icelandic girl They were joined in Valparaiso by Chilean mountaineer Pablo Besser on the st October After considerable bureaucratic problems with the Chilean government they all set sail for Canal Baker and the Jorge Montt Glacier at the northern end of the ice cap While Fuchs and team began their journey south the boat sailed to the Peel Fjord and Besser with the Icelandic girl Sigga Ragna Sverrisdotir an excellent ice climber travelled over km in an inflatable dingy to the head of the Peel There they climbed up a steep and previously unexplored glacier christened Margarita Glacier on to the ice cap Pulling days food and equipment on pulks they finally reached the Japan Plateau and headed east for two days to make their first Base C near to the Malaspina Mountains From there they climbed Cerro Centinel m in poor conditions and Cerro Dagmar Aaen m the latter in soft snow ending with a m ice pitch and a classic Patagonian mushroom After a spell of bad weather they moved c to the base of Cerro Immaculado m where they made the first ascents of Immaculado Mirador del Hielo m Punta Ilusion m and Punta Aparicion m These have now been adopted as official names and heights on versions of maps to the area Besser and Sverrisdotir were also the first to cross the Garcia Glacier and Col m or Corredor Chileno Fuchs with team members Till Gottbrath and Roger Schmitt met up with the pair on the th November but a day storm which destroyed one of the tents put paid to the journey further south and the entire team traversed the Falle de Reichert Mayo Fall a c m chasm of seracs cutting the ice cap never before crossed except by helicopter and reached the Peel Fjord on the rd December While completing this route Besser Gottbrath Schmitt and Sverrisdotir made the first ascent of Cerro Cuatro Vientos The significance of the Arved Cross is that it was the longest north south traverse of the ice cap yet made without helicopter support or mid journey stop for a rest and re stock Besser hoped to return with three friends and make the first complete traverse of all km of the Hielo Sur during the season but the outcome of this proposed expedition is still unknown An interesting west to east traverse of the ice cap took place in March when Germans Carsten Birckhahn Merten Puschmann and Tilman Steinhardt took just over four weeks to travel from Peel Fjord to the Lago Argentina They first reached the fjord with plastic kayaks and then using them as pulks dragged their equipment m up on to the ice cap and continued east Their original project was to carry on down via the Santa Cruz river all the way to the Atlantic coast but it is thought that this part of their novel journey may well have been aborted Paine Due to the counter productive act by CONAF still in operation during the season of charging a high fee for climbing in the National Park only teams registered to climb during the entire six months of the austral summer Perhaps as a consequence of this and due also to continued foreign pressure the authorities reduced the fee previously per climbing team to per person for the season Although far from a perfect solution to the problem the new fee does encourage small teams in the area though the authorities still make no attempt to provide a service for the royalty News from the past season is still scanty though there has been a new route but not to the summit on The Shield a hard big wall route on the East Face of Cerro Cota in the Frances Valley and a second ascent of the Thomas Turner line Caveman on Cuerno Norte in the same valley For the moment we take the opportunity to catch up on previously unreported ascents from early The Towers After completing the Arved Cross Expedition described above Pablo Besser arrived at Paine in January Besser epitomized most Chilean nationals at the time in that he was furious at suddenly having to pay in order to climb in his own country He made two attempts on the South Tower by the North Ridge the original Aste Route c m F and A but was defeated by the weather However as a consolation he managed to climb the ever popular Monzino Route which forms the original and classic route of ascent on the South Ridge of the North Tower with Englishman Martin Chester on the th The two climbed the m route above Col Bich in a fast three and a half hours at VI and A Also in the Paine during January and February was the American team of Scott Lazar Michael Pennings and Cameron Tague These three first made the second ascent of the Piola Sprungli route Ultima Esperanza m b and A on the West Pillar of the North Tower s South Summit They climbed the route in a day with a three pitch variation at a grade of c and A Later after three days of preparation the same three climbed the West Face of the Central Tower by the Italian route Via de las Mamas Barbolini de Dona Pozzi R ini Veghetti m b and A This was the second ascent Finally they completed the trilogy by reaching the summit of the South Tower via the original but still infrequently ascended Aste Route Earlier the little repeated British Route on the Central Tower Bonington Whillans m best free attempt now b with some aid but thought to be possible at a b received an ascent in Alpine style by the strong German Australian team of Carsten Birckhahn and Andrew McAuley They climbed the route in December and are thought to be only the third party to have summited the Central Tower without a bivouac Afterwards the same pair were reported to have climbed the North Tower twice first by the Monzino Route and then by making the second ascent of The Corn Wall the South West Rib climbed in by Celia Bull Leigh McGinley and Paul Pritchard at b pitches to the junction with the Monzino Route The Pingo Valley In the Pingo Valley which runs north from Lago Nordenskjold to the South Tower and gives access to the East Faces of the Cuernos the Chilean pair of Sven Bruchfeld and Christian Oberli made the first ascent of the East Face of Hoja in January This pitch c m route was climbed in classic style using fixed ropes at a reported grade of a and A In February the Americans Pennings and Tague also turned their attention to the valley first climbing the m high East Face of Cuerno Este via a line graded and A and then a route on the East Face of Hoja which they christened Anduril the relation between this and the Chilean Route a month previously is unknown This last climb was completed in a round trip of hours from the valley and was almost entirely free The first climb ever to be achieved from the Pingo Valley only took place in the East Face of Cuerno Norte Last year three parties succeeded on four routes Apart from those just described a team of young Germans were successful in completing the first ascent of Cuerno Principle s East Face see INFO Note Last minute correspondence following interviews with several Italian climbers involved in some of the routes mentioned in this report suggests that comments regarding whether or not summits were reached or routes completed may have arisen from misinformation Details and or corrections will appear in the next issue INFO Pablo Besser John Biggar Greg Crouch Rolando Garibotti Mike Jenkins Lorenzo Nadali Manlio Motto Dave Pegg Emanuele Pellizzari BOLIVIA Cordillera Real Jallawaya In INFO we reported ascents in the Negruni Jankho Kkota region of the Central Cordillera Real The mountains to the north of the Jankho Kkota valley in which the British party climbed are referred to as the Warawarini and Keakeani groups on the new Cordova map However the American cartographer Liam O Brien has made extensive research into this region delineated in the north by the Chachacomani Pass c m south of the Chachacomani Massif and discovered that the highest summit Pt m first climbed in by Japanese repeated in by O Brien and then again in by the British party should strictly be called Jallawaya I after the main river valley that drains the mountain to the south Following the convention of naming a group of mountains by the highest peak he proposes that this whole range of mountains which probably contains around summits over m should logically be named the Jallawaya Group German climbers Edi Birnbacher and Stefan Wiebel chose to visit the Jallawaya Negruni region in February This is the austral summer the rainy season and a time in which few ever visit the mountains However the German pair were aware that in recent years glacial recession had been significant and steep faces melted quickly with the arrival of the customary fine weather in late May June leaving vast areas of bare rotten rock although not all the granite in this region is poor Certainly by mid June many of the couloirs used by parties that made the first ascents of these fine peaks in the early s are now snow free stone swept chutes While the Germans found large quantities of snow on the mountains and acceptable conditions for mixed climbing they unfortunately coincided with the worst wet season for years and experienced copious amounts of bad weather On the th February they climbed a new route Pan Duro on the right side of the South West Face of Cerro Culin Thojo South m This m high mixed climb had rock difficulties of IV and snow ice to Three pegs were left in the rotten rock Two days later they climbed Andal eacute a m mixed route up the North Couloir of Pt m to the west of Cerro Ventanani Again the rock was poor IV maximum and the snow ice climbing between with one section of Finally on the th the pair climbed the East Face of Pt m the location of which is unclear though it is described as a subsidiary peak of Wila Lloje The m climb christened Caramba which involved rock to IV and snow ice to was again primarily composed of loose blocks and the ubiquitous rotten rock Two pegs and a sling were abandoned on the climb All these peaks or sub peaks lie close to the valley and most probably received their first ascents during when two large German expeditions explored the region However it is quite possible that the recent exploration by the two Germans produced the first new routes ever climbed in the Cordillera during the summer On the th a big landslide destroyed the WD access road which now continues over the Paso Mullu and down to the jungle villages Birnbacher and Wiebel had no option but to walk out to the main highway a distance of km Despite this they

Juan Villarroel Queen Maud Land In Ivar Erik Tollefsen led a Norwegian expedition to Dronning Maud Land on mainland Antarctica The expedition gained considerable media attention and produced a fine book which detailed the various stages of the project including the first ascent from the th January th February of Ulvetanna m via a m climb up the North West Face VIII and A The route was climbed in capsule style by Robert Caspersen a very talented rock climber and one of Norway s former indoor ch ions the very experienced Sjur Nesheim and Tollefsen In late Tollefsen again led a small team to Queen Maud Land this time to the Sor Rondane a region of mountains never previously visited by a climbing expedition Together with a four person media team Tollefsen Caspersen Aslak Aastorp and H aring kon Staver first flew by chartered Hercules from Cape Town to the Fenrisskjeften on the Icecap the venue for the expedition From there a ski equipped twin otter aircraft took the team km east to a Base C in the mountain range of Sor Rondane From here they spent days climbing the m high South East Face of Rondespiret Rondespiret is a Trango Tower like granite peak and the four climbed the obvious pillar and corner system on the left side of the face in sustained pitches of mixed free and aid climbing up to new wave A and VI see topo Extremely strong winds combined with cold stable weather caused many problems especially on the lower half of the route On Ulvetenna in Caspersen and team had found the granite often loose and friable due no doubt to the harsh and variable climatic environment This time the four Norwegians again climbing in capsule style found mostly good steep granite with a few notable and serious exceptions and completed the route from the rd December th January INFO Aslak Aastorp North America ALASKA Kichatna Spires As reported in INFO two new routes were completed in the Alaskan Cathedral Range more popularly known as the Kichatna Spires during June by years old American Calder Stratford and British climber Kevin Thaw Thaw who took up partial residence in the USA in the late s and is now more or less resident there was the first British climber to lead consensus A with his ascent of Sea of Dreams on Yosemite s El Capitan in The pair were flown into the unfrequented region south of the McKinley group on the th May and deposited on the Tatina Glacier Heeding the advice that when the unpredictable weather sets fair in this region climbers should not waste any time there are no real hours of darkness at this latitude until August the pair set out for a fine granite wall on an unnamed m peak immediately west of Tatina Spire The south buttress of what they later dubbed Punter s Peak gave seven m pitches to the interminable summit ridge This in turn offered easy Fifth Class climbing with the occasional boulder problem Two days were spent on the buttress and ropes were fixed single bolt belays on to the headwall where flaring cracks and loose exfoliating flakes gave more free climbing Three of the pitches crossing a series of roofs were entirely on aid modern A with much use of copperheads and skyhooks The free climbing standard on the rest reached a maximum of The route was christened Dreams of Sea and given an overall V rating The weather turned bad for the next days or so then miraculously cleared three days before the pre arranged flight out Stratford and Thaw quickly assembled gear for an attempt on a southern satellite of Tatina Spire and starting just right of the lowest point of the south buttress free climbed the often lichenous wall which prompted the route name Alaskan Rose to the golden headwall This formed the crux and had some run out climbing with a steep crack trough at c More lichen forced them out left into a corner system near the top They reached the summit after a total of nine long pitches placing single bolt belays backed up with rivets Alaskan Rose was also rated V Though these two routes were fairly short they were probably the steepest that the valley had to offer Cathedral Mountains Not to be confused with the group of spires above this small isolated range of peaks which appear to offer fine granite walls up to m high lie west of Mt Foraker and until last year had not previously been visited by any climber It was therefore perhaps rather apt that the first party into the region should have as one of its members the greatest of all American pioneers the indefatigable Fred Beckey Together with Calvin Herbert and the well known big wall guru John Middendorf Beckey who has now climbed over new routes in North America attempted the unnamed highest summit in the group The only real technical piece of climbing involved a loose rock wall to gain the fine summit snow ridge Beckey led this pitch and in deference to the years old living legend the other two climbers propose the name Mount Beckey for the m summit Mount Foraker Jeff Benowitz soloed a new route on a spur that lies between Mt Crosson and the Japanese Route through the North East Icefall Benowitz reached the crest via a m couloir on the north flank in order to bypass the loose rock buttress that terminates the spur He then continued for pitches all of which he backroped up the narrow corniced crest to an easing in difficulty Continuing unroped Benowitz reached the crest of the Sultana Ridge at c m Due to poor weather throughout his time on the mountain the hours of climbing that Benowitz spent in completing the route now christened The Way was in fact spread over six days The Japanese Route climbed during the third ascent of the mountain reaches the crest of the Sultana higher up While it is technically straightforward and has been repeated on several occasions it is very prone to snow and ice avalanches McKinley Apart from Steve House s ascent of the Washburn Wall reported in INFO another new route was climbed on the Great One during Slovakians Juraj Hreus and Jan Surcek started climbing parallel to the Messner Couloir then traversed up and left past Bugs McKeith s solo climb McClod s Rib and Scott Johnston s Hourglass Couloir to reach the series of rocky ribs on the North West Face lying above the traverse out to Denali Pass on the Standard Route Twenty five pitches of mixed ground from up these ribs led to the summit ridge Wrangell Mountains Paul Barry David Hart Harry Hunt and David Lacey climbed a new route on the m Mt Natazhat The four climbers followed the c km crest of the North East Ridge from a starting height of m A narrow corniced ridge led over Pt m and Pt m before reaching the final m summit ridge which proved to be the crux of the climb Their ascent also proved to be only the second of this mountain St Elias Range Mount Miller Carlos Buhler Paul Claus Ruedi Homberger Reto Ruesh and Charlie Sassara made the first ascent of the highest remaining unclimbed peak in the St Elias Range From an airdrop at only m on the Bagley Icefield the five climbers tackled a broad south facing spur leading up on to the crest of the West Ridge of Miller at c m They then followed the increasingly difficult crest for five and a half kilometres to the m summit successfully negotiating the crux section over a steep icy dome The route which had a vertical interval of over m was climbed in a continuous hours Coastal Range Devil s Thumb Spanish climber Sim oacute n Elias and American Chad McMullen climbed a new route on the North West Face of the Cat s Ear Spire the neighbouring rock tower to the Devil s Thumb close to the border between Southern Alaska and British Columbia After an initial ice couloir with a step of over a rimaye leading up to the notch below the North West Pillar where they made a first bivouac the pair climbed on the right flank of the ridge with a second bivouac to the summit The initial section was a and A then the route continued free with passages of The total length of the climb was m The pair were then joined by Jeff Selvig for an unsuccessful attempt on the South West Diedre of the Thumb The route started with m of vertical rock a just left of the crest of the South Pillar then worked up left to reach the huge diedre in the middle of the face a and A maximum After m of climbing and one bivouac the trio were less than m from the summit when it appears that a rockfall hit the ledge where they had left their bivouac gear and carried away sleeping bags Not wanting to risk a night out unequipped in the prevailing low temperatures the team decided to retreat This spectacular granite monolith was first climbed in by Beckey Craig and Schmidtke INFO Kevin Thaw YOSEMITE The Valley experienced a ravaging wet year in The season had barely started when a huge storm hit the area Several feet of snow then began to melt quickly in the warmth of May and the resulting run off caused the rivers to flood The Merced burst its banks causing havoc in the c grounds and washing away both possessions and aspirations of visiting climbers Perhaps not entirely unrelated to this deluge was the huge rockfall on the th July from close to the rim above Glacier Point Apron This event which has already been well reported in a previous High flattened one and a half metre diameter trees nearly one kilometre away and killed one person The fall left everything covered with large quantities of dust and a huge area of scarred earth with unstable boulders perched high above the Apron The Park Authorities closed the area from Goodrich Pinnacle east which includes routes on the Mouth and the Cow and also the line of Galactic Hitchhiker perhaps the longest free rock climb in the USA completed in the autumn of by Matt Brooks and Lou Renner at VI a b This route described in High has pitches to the rim out of which are new It remains to be seen whether routes such as these are still entirely intact To add insult to injury the season ended with the usual if somewhat premature snowfall However this was later followed by a warm wet storm For the second time in a year the Merced broke its banks and welled up over the valley floor this time creating the biggest flood in history with considerably more devastation than its spring counterpart Several c grounds were totally washed away as was a sewerage line and many large boulders were deposited on various roads around the park The Cookie cliff suffered considerable fresh rockfall as did many of the other crags which line Highway between El Portal and the Valley The worse flooding appears to have been caused by debris clogging up the watercourse at Pohono Bridge near to Bridalveil Falls The resulting dam forced water back in to the Valley and briefly closed all the Park exits At one stage Yosemite Lodge Yosemite Village and Curry Village were all isolated from one another by flood water A large boulder destroyed the dining room of the Parkline Restaurant at El Portal and the rest of the building was burned in order to prevent debris from creating another blockage Both Pines c grounds the River c grounds and the Housekeeping area suffered major damage and some of these may never re open However Sunnyside the traditional climbers c is some distance above the river and appears to have survived relatively unscathed The Park remained closed from January March and although at the time of writing details of the current situation are unknown the repair cost has been estimated at around There is a rumour that the Park Service may try to introduce a system of one day permits for visitors though whether this would effect climbers attempting multi day routes is unsure The Big Walls El Capitan Our report in INFO concerning the second and third ascent of Dante s Inferno contained several minor errors The second ascent was made by two Americans and not Scandinavians as stated and took five not four days The third ascent by the Danish climber Ravn Hamberg and the Swiss Aischan Rupp which resulted in the first one day ascent began at am with the pair carrying one small rucksack between them Also omitted from the report on the previous autumn s activities was probably the first single push ascent of El Capitan s Aquarian Wall in hours during October by Rupp and the Argentinian climber Rolando Garibotti Rupp was back in the Valley again in early summer and teamed up with the Norwegian Lofoten Islands expert Odd Roar Wiik to make the fifth ascent of the hard test piece Jolly Roger This route was first climbed in by Charles Cole and Steve Grossmann but has seen few subsequent attempts let alone repeats second ascent in days by the late Xaver Bongard from Switzerland climbing solo third by the well known American Brad Jarret also climbing solo fourth in by the Slovenians Janez Jeglic and Miha Prapotnik The Swiss Norwegian pair climbed the pitch route VI A which begins above the Mammoth Ledges on the South West Face between The Shield and Son of Heart in seven days from the th to the th June Their ascent was made in Alpine style without fixing ropes The pair used epoxy putty to reinstate much of the original hard climbing by filling up many of the drilled holes added after the Cole Grossman ascent As one activist said there have been a mistaken few in the past who have sought out glory on the big walls and reduced the commitment by drilling for security Sadly Rupp was killed earlier this year in a rappel accident while descending the Hornli Ridge on the Matterhorn having just completed a very fast winter ascent of the North Face Born in from mixed German Tadjikistan parentage Rupp was no newcomer to the Yosemite scene having visited the Valley on a regular basis over the past few years and had completed big wall routes on El Cap His tally included the first solo and fifth overall ascent of Native Son VI A to the right of The North America Wall Gulf Stream routes on the South East Face climbed in in the sixth ascent of Aurora VI and A with Oyvind Moss and in the first single push ascent of Sunkist VI A in hours with Garibotti the route had received less than ascents at the time In the same year he made a nine hours ascent of the Salath eacute Wall also with Garibotti Perhaps falling into the category of climbers who have reduced the commitment by drilling for security is the pair who completed the now controversial Wings of Steel They were busy drilling on El Cap for over a month with the drill heard on a daily basis Even a Park ranger was prompted to turn out to discourage their cause This route seems to avoid any available features instead taking a blank plum line directly up the wall The tactics apparently used were to drill small holes into which copperheads could be pasted The second would then consistently chop the head cables flush with the rock rendering each placement useless for a subsequent ascent In contrast a highly praised event in May on which no additional drilling appears to have taken place was the second ascent of the infamous offering from Randy Leavitt and the late Rob Slater named Scorched Earth Chris Kalous and Chris Righter spent five days completing this VI A route The crux pitch the Big Brother involves hard copperheading in rotten rock and a single hook move requiring a device which Leavitt dubbed a Lovetron Kalous and Righter also used their version of a Lovetron a tent pole with a steering wire and a skyhook attached to the end for an extremely long reach Later Kalous and Rubecca Rusch had made another important second ascent when they spent seven days climbing Bermuda Dunes VI A Kalous kept a busy big wall schedule in In March he made a solo winter ascent of the Cap starting up the first eight pitches of Lost in America VI A then making a short traverse on to Tangerine Trip VI A finishing on the summit after a total of nine days on the face He and Righter also took their experience to the Cirque of the Unclimbables in the summer and with Kevin Daniels and Gregg Epperson added another hard wall route Grendel VI A to Mount Proboscis Sadly the late spring was also the scene of a fatality on El Cap when American Mathew Baxter was killed while attempting to solo Zenyatta Mondatta Baxter took what should have been a short fall on the third pitch but his backrope got jammed behind a flake and cut through After the spring water had subsided years old San Francisco climber Chris McNamara completed Sea of Dreams VI A with Mark Melvin and Wyoming Sheep Ranch VI A with Eric Sloan Another successful ascent of this last named route was made by Wally Barker Returning from a productive trip to Baffin Island where with Kohn Rysekchi he completed new routes on Asgard and Friga Barker despatched the route solo Slovenians added another of the big nail ups to their tally when Boris Lorencic and Armand Polegek climbed Aurora VI A in six days after fixing the first four pitches Eric Kohl who has established over big wall routes in the Park most of them solo added another to the nearby Falls Wall but details are unknown There were again many notable speed ascents of routes on the walls The prolific team of Dave Bengston Steve Gerberding and Scott Stowe were as usual well motivated They began with the first ever continuous ascent of Iron Hawk VI A in hours and minutes Their next project was a continuous ascent of Lost in America VI A which they despatched in a very rapid hours and minutes The same three also set a speed record for Lunar Eclipse completing this line in hours minutes Bengston and Stowe then teamed up with Conrad Anker for a record hours and two minutes ascent of Mirage VI A while Anker this time with Hans Florine and Mark Melvin reduced the record time for an ascent of the North America Wall to under hours completing this VI A route in just hours and minutes Florine and young Chris McNamara stomped up the Muir Wall VI A in a record hours and minutes Two important solo record ascents were achieved in Argentinian born Damien Benegas made an ascent of the classic Zenyatta Mondatta VI A in an unrelenting hours and minutes while Kevin Thaw took only hours and eight minutes to overcome the often wide cracks of the equally classic West Buttress VI A Benegas has now climbed El Cap wall routes on more than occasions a total of ascents possibly only beaten by the prolific Steve Gerberding who has now climbed the captain on well over occasions Having warmed up by climbing the Regular Route on Half Dome see below and making an ascent of Zodiac American resident Abby Watkins and fellow Australian Vera Wong beat Nancy Feagin and Sue McDevitt s all female record for The Nose lowering the time to hours and minutes The pair began the route at am on the th September and had to climb over and around six other parties before reaching the top Finally also marked the third all free ascent of the Salath eacute This time it was the turn of Thomas Huber brother to Alex who made the well publicized second ascent Thomas led all the pitches including the th a and the two b pitches on the headwall Half Dome In July Peter Coward and the well known Valley speed climber Hans Florine achieved the remarkable feat of linking the Regular and Direct Routes on the North West Face in a single day The Direct was climbed in a record hours and the Regular in three hours and minutes This inspired various other fast ascents on the wall and in mid August Coward and Florine returned driving from San Francisco climbing the Regular Route in just one minute over three hours and driving back in under hours The all women s record for this route was also beaten last year when the Australians Abby Watkins and Vera Wong climbed the route in just nine hours and minutes Wong and Willy Benegas also reportedly completed the Direct Route in hours and minutes The last word however came on Friday the th of September when the well known Slovenian Silvo Karo teamed up with Aischan Rupp making his second short trip to the Valley last year to climb the Direct in probably a new record time of hours and minutes The pair felt that this time could easily be improved as conditions for the ascent were far from ideal Halfway up the route it started to rain and this turned to snow near the top INFO Dave Pegg Aischan Rupp Kevin Thaw North American Ice Colorado In parallel to the tremendous activity in Europe this winter which successfully appears to have raised the technical standards of the new wave mixed climbing reported in the next issue America has also seen its share of impressive performances in and there is now a definite trend towards working and redpointing short difficult mixed problems The big breakthrough of the season was Will Gadd s route Amphibian a two pitch bolt protected line in the near vicinity of Octopussy at the laboratory of Vail After considerable time and effort bolting the route from above Gadd worked on the line for three weeks before making a clean lead of every section The route is a little over m long with the top overhanging the base by around m It has two pitches the first of which Gadd a noted Canadian sport climber redpointed at the beginning of March and the second somewhat harder pitch a week or so later However he was apparently unable climb the entire route in one complete ascent A rating of M or even M placed it in a new league of mixed climbing and made it a full grade harder than test pieces such as Octopussy The first pitch which is around m in length and graded climbs an overhanging rock wall on which there is absolutely no ice whatsoever The second involves a start on ice followed by two horizontal roofs of about m each and separated by an icicle at the top of which it is possible to get a good rest then more ice above the roofs to reach the top Quickly on the scene was Stevie Haston This was Haston s second visit to the USA to climb ice during the winter the first involving attendance at the ESPN ice climbing competition set up by Jeff Lowe and the Ouray Ice Festival Haston has spent almost six months this winter concentrating solely on his ice mixed climbing on average three and sometimes five days a week This appears to have paid off with a remarkable series of new routes details of which will appear in the next issue when we review the European Alpine winter On his first visit in January February he repeated Jeff Lowe s hard mixed route of Resurrection This is a typical Vail climb overcoming seriously impending rock to reach a free hanging icicle Lowe placed protection no bolts on aid then worked the route like a sport climb He felt it had a longer series of moves than Octopussy in its original condition but was about the same order of technical difficulty He rated it M Haston flashed it finding it an excellent though complex mixed climb and felt it to be Over in the Ice Park of Ouray Haston climbed a scary which in some ways he felt was the hardest thing he did all winter The route took a slender tapering hanging icicle that was only possible to climb by hooking and hugging It was top roped first as it was initially thought too fragile for a complete ascent The Box Canyon at Ouray was home to around climbers and an equal number of spectators for the Festival As reported in a previous INFO pure ice climbs are artificially created here using sprinkler valves on a large waterpipe that runs around the rim Though most climbs are top roped the routes still make very fine leads These half or one pitch climbs can be changed at will well in about three days to a week and the atmosphere is very friendly with the town encouraging climbing and giving discounts to visiting climbers Many of these visitors are now performing at a very high standard reaching grade after just a few weekends Notable routes are Bloody Sunday by Mark Wilford and a second route at the same grade by Will Gadd and his usual partner on the ice the prolific resident climber from Iceland Helgi Christensen Haston s second visit to the USA appears to have been even more productive Now at his strongest ever he first repeated Pete Takeda s recent route Fat Man and Robin originally worked over several days The route involves a three metre overhang and was graded by the first ascensionists Haston came close to flashing it and on his subsequent ascent felt that in reality it was probably only Fat Man and Robin is another line in the immediate vicinity of The Fang and Octopussy at Vail starting with the usual section of overhanging rock leading to a stalactite with the crux roof at the top Amphibian took him two days On the first session Haston had to resort to rest points on the top pitch but completed it clean on the second day The first pitch was thought to be rather than The initial roof on the second pitch he found to be quite juggy and he did it without ice tools or gloves where possible this does less damage to the rock and Gadd had taken a fall here when an axe placement broke The second he climbed at Haston s feeling is that the leading American climbers are making very real but smaller progress than was first thought and the top grade is being expanded somewhat disproportionately He also feels that his new routes Welcome to the Machine and in Italy s Val Savaranche now possibly the first genuine M s in the world have harder and more powerful moves and equally more demanding and fragile ice though are not as long as the routes at Vail Before leaving the USA Haston turned his overworked arms to the desert sandstone and became the first person to climb one of the main Fisher Towers without aid when he spent three days cleaning working and then free climbing Echo Tower by the line of Phantom Spirit The hard mixed routes being put up in Europe at present of which Trait de Lune a m high unconfirmed M in the eastern region of Switzerland s Jura mountains by the well known German Alpinist Robert Jasper is another ex le need cr ons to both start and finish the climbing Jasper s route includes an impressive bulge climbed free with bare hands cr ons and the somewhat limiting effect of full winter clothing and still thought to be around F a b Amphibian in contrast has a first pitch that is entirely on rock It may now be time to re assess what proportion of pure un iced rock should exist on a route in order for it to still be considered a mixed climb even by American standards The potential for climbing long rock walls to reach small hanging icicles is still vast and dry tooling is all the rage Certain climbers had suggested taking their axes and cr ons to the sport cliff of Rifle until they were made to realize the damage such an act would do to existing rock climbs Newcomer Gary Ryan also felt he had made a breakthrough by climbing Blade Runner at the popular Loch Vale area in Rocky Mountain National Park This route ascends m of overhanging granite to reach a thin ice curtain leading m to the top and is situated very close to several other recently created mixed routes Ryan brother of the British rock climber Tony Ryan and now an American resident placed three bolts plus four pegs then began working Blade Runner in late February On one of his attempts he had almost reached the top and was pulling on a small tree root when it snapped resulting in a spectacular fall Ryan finally redpointed the route on the th March giving it a rating of M Subsequent appraisal by certain other climbers and a flashed second ascent by Will Gadd confirmed that the standard was no more than M Ryan s subsequent failure to climb Resurrection seems to bear this out However Ryan a very strong climber undoubtedly did make a meteoric impact on the climbing world taking to the ice for the first time after years of rock climbing He quickly on sighted Secret Probation M at Vail and then went on to make only the second on sight ascent of Octopussy Other routes include a repeat of David Sheldon s Free Strike Zone M and a new route at Ouray Easter Rising which he gave a grade of M though this again is now widely believed to be somewhat over rated With the potential at Vail drying up other venues are now being examined At Glenwood Canyon Gadd and Jeff Lowe climbed Deep Throat a five star that apart from a few metres of rock in its m length is entirely on ice Another M has also been reported this time in the Cascade Canyon region of the state where Big Wall climber Jared Ogden and partner climbed Against the Grain The route actually followed the line of a hard but yet to be redpointed F b bolted rock climbing project negotiating a roof to reach ice above There have been attempts recently to equate ice to rock grades in order to try to answer the question as to what level mixed climbing is at relative to rock Gadd felt that Amphibian felt equivalent to a sport climb Although it is obviously impossible to make a direct comparison the following consensus at present gives a very rough indication of the physical difficulty involved with making an ascent of a short hard but well protected route such as those found at Vail M or F b or well protected E M or b to a or well protected E M or a to b M to or c to a M a to b INFO Stevie Haston Gary Ryan
