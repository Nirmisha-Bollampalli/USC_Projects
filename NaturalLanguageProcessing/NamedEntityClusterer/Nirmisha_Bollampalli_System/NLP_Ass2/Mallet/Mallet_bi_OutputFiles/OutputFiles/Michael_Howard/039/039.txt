Michael Howard Andrew Roth Friday March Guardian Unlimited Michael Howard the former Tory home secretary is one of those half ghosts from Tory cabinets who materialise on the backbenches to indicate that they are not quite dead to do a spot of Labour bashing In his case one can almost see the dagger in his back inscribed something of the night Piquantly Ann Widdecombe his former junior who thus maligned him has surged into popularity as the more rightwing alternative to Michael Portillo and potential successor to William Hague Article continues Mr Howard was the last of the Tory Cambridge Mafia of the s which included Kenneth Clarke John Gummer Norman Fowler and Leon Brittan to retire to the back benches He came up via Llanelli grammar school in Gorseinon near Swansea where his Romanian Jewish shopkeeper father had settled At school he was one of only two Jewish pupils The family name of Hecht was anglicised to Howard In and he contested two parliamentary elections for the Conservative party at Edge Hill Liverpool before finding a safe seat years later in Folkestone and Hythe The delay was partly because of his desire to make his way as a successful barrister in planning and employment law but also provided a chance to cement his marriage to ex model Saundra Paul her fourth his first Once in the Commons Mr Howard established his rightwing views In his maiden speech he urged legal protection for strike breakers and endorsed the restoration of the death penalty and US intervention in Grenada Within two years he had begun his climb up the greasy pole of politics A populist home secretary from to John Major s election defeat he fought crime by locking people up to the dismay of top judges and his more centrist predecessors like Douglas Hurd His tough line saw crime drop by and made him the darling of the tabloids but he was seriously undermined by his handling of the resignation of the Derek Lewis the director of prisons in Mr Lewis fell on his sword when a report into the escape of prisoners from Whitemoor prison highlighted serious deficiencies in the system Mr Howard almost suffered the same fate when he was asked about whether he had made Mr Lewis a scapegoat times by Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight Despite this public relations disaster Mr Howard managed to maintain widespread support in the press due to his Europhobia As the senior Eurosceptic in John Major s cabinet he pursued many battles with Europhile Ken Clarke and seemed well placed to succeed Mr Major This hope was destroyed in the first round of the Tory leadership battle following their May defeat After William Hague reneged on a deal to run as Mr Howard s deputy Mr Howard came fifth with votes He then backed the much younger man and was rewarded with the post of shadow foreign secretary He spent the next two years doing little else other than demanding Robin Cook s resignation Although still very pro American and against a federal Europe Mr Howard no longer fitted in with Hague s Little England Europhobes who criticised him for supporting Nato s attack on Serbia as a just war After Mr Hague announced plans for kitchen table Conservatism in March Mr Howard retired from frontbench politics to the relative comfort of his well cushioned boardrooms There he can exhibit his QC s mind expressed with a slight Welsh accent in his smoothly courteous personal manner The departure of Derek Lewis made an enemy of Ann Widdecombe and probably ended Mr Howard s chances of becoming leader He must often think what might have been if those convicts had not gone over the wall in Whitemoor Ask Aristotle about Michael Howard Privacy policy Terms conditions Advertising guide A Z index About this site Guardian Unlimited copy Guardian News and Media
