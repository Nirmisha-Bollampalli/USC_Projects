Blair October AM Print this article Email to a friend Michael Howard looks on as his leader bows out Photo AFP Most people who have had personal dealings with Michael Howard have found him an engaging and scrupulously polite individual He is articulate as befits a QC fiercely intelligent and honest Yet his image in the country is as a ruthless Right wing ideologue someone who intimidated Whitehall officials and who places ambition ahead of principle He was once called the most hated home secretary in living memory Ann Widdecombe who served as his deputy at the Home Office said there was something of the night about him an opaque yet intentionally unflattering description that has stalked him ever since and probably always will Rarely in politics has the public persona so belied the private man How has this demonisation come about It derives principally from his time as home secretary when his insistence on tougher penalties for criminals offended the sensibilities of the liberals whose law and order policies had so palpably failed that the Tory government faced the gravest crime crisis in history Mr Howard s tough line famously set out in his points at the Conservative conference in also found little favour with the judiciary who felt that their independence was being constrained They fought his attempts at reform tooth and nail feeding an impression of ministerial disarray that by then had infected the entire Tory government Yet there is little that Mr Howard proposed then that was not taken up by the Labour government in and built on subsequently by Jack Straw and now David Blunkett The penal slogan most commonly associated with Mr Howard is prison works From the moment he became home secretary a stewardship that began with the public angst generated by the appalling murder of Jamie Bulger by two year old boys the prison population began to increase But this was not the direct consequence of any legislation more a response by the courts to a perceived desire on the part of the public articulated by politicians for tougher sentences Mr Howard s most draconian measures the so called three strikes and you re out provision for repeat burglars and mandatory sentences for serial drug traffickers were actually enacted by Labour after Furthermore the prison population has risen even faster under the current Government without its ministers attracting the same opprobrium Mr Howard s time at the Home Office was blighted by several high profile prison escapes and there is no question that he might have handled the fall out better He gave the impression of a politician seeking to blame his officials Derek Lewis the director general of the Prison Service was fired Miss Widdecombe s animus stems from this period But the fact remains that burglaries and car thefts began to fall from onwards when measured by the British Crime Survey which is the current Government s favoured benchmark It is a record for which a home secretary might in other circumstances expect congratulations Mr Howard however merely endured brickbats This was as much a function of the terminal decline of the Major government which Mr Howard came to epitomise as a coherent critique of his achievements His earlier ministerial association with the poll tax though his were not the only fingerprints at the scene and the privatisation of water now uncontroversial then mightily divisive contributed to the image His opposition to further European integration offended Europhile Tories at the time but is now mainstream party policy As home secretary he made mistakes and suffered defeats He was probably wrong to increase the sentence tariff on the Bulger killers but he felt it was his function to reflect public revulsion Like Mr Blunkett he wanted to introduce ID cards but was beaten back by a cabinet revolt He tried to limit trial by jury just as the present Government is doing but lost in the Lords He introduced an ill considered ban on handguns but after the Dunblane massacre the political pressure for prohibition was almost irresistable However there is a good deal of revisionism now taking place about Mr Howard s stewardship of the Home Office His predecessors Douglas Hurd and Kenneth Clarke are seen as too soft during their time in the post the crime level grew to more than five million Even today the criminal justice measures he wanted to introduce then are going through Parliament in one shape or another making it difficult for Labour to traduce his time at the Home Office Born in south Wales in the son of Jewish immigrants from Romania Michael Howard was educated at Llanelli Grammar School He went on to study law at Cambridge where his debating skills made him a star of the Union His contemporaries included Kenneth Clarke Norman Lamont John Gummer Leon Brittan and Norman Fowler a group of friends who became known as the Cambridge mafia Two decades later they occupied the upper reaches of the Thatcher and Major cabinets though Mr Howard arrived at Westminster later after searching forlornly for a seat and then practising as a planning lawyer In the meantime he had married Sandra Paul a Sixties model who calls him an extraordinarily romantic man They have two children and one of the strongest of Westminster marriages After he became MP for Folkestone in his rise was meteoric and he reached the Cabinet within seven years By he was well positioned to challenge for the succession to John Major yet secured just votes from his fellow MPs trailing in last Some felt he was too clever by half others that he trimmed his sails according to the prevailing political winds Their suspicions were articulated by Miss Widdecombe At this point it must have been tempting to return to the Bar or earn a lot of money in the City Instead he took up the post of shadow foreign secretary under William Hague for two years before returning to the backbenches When Iain Duncan Smith took over in Mr Howard was the surprise choice as shadow chancellor where he swiftly consolidated his reputation as a forensic and powerful Commons performer Yet while his qualities are known to his colleagues and his parliamentary skills are unquestionable he will have the hardest task persuading voters that he is not an unfeeling and faintly sinister throwback to the Major era It is a caricature that Mr Howard s friends find hard to fathom His interests are catholic he likes football Liverpool is his team and horse racing he enjoys a wide range of music from jazz to pop he rarely speaks disparagingly of colleagues even in private an unusual trait among politicians He is fiercely loyal Throughout the recent Tory leadership fiasco few will have heard him utter anything derogatory about Mr Duncan Smith He was standing by the Tory leader outside Conservative Central Office on Tuesday just as he stood by Mr Major in his troubled times In his memoirs Mr Major wrote Michael is clever and able but in private is a shy and charming man with an unstuffy self deprecating manner He was always at his best without an audience in public he could not help stirring things up Too many people saw the polished barrister on the surface and took against what they saw They missed the substance underneath If he becomes Tory leader that substance will be sorely tested over the next two years The Telegraph London Print this article Email to a friend Top Search all Fairfax archives Fee for full article National World Opinion Business Technology Sport Entertainment Multimedia
