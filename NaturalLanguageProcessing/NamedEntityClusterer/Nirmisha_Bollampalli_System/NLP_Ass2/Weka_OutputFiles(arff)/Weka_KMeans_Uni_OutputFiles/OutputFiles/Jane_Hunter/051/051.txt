library project to provide a common conceptual model to facilitate interoperability between metadata ontologies from different domains This updated ABC model is the result of collaboration with the CIMI consortium whereby earlier versions of the ABC model were applied to metadata descriptions of complex objects provided by CIMI museums and libraries The result is a metadata model with more logically grounded time and entity semantics Based on this model we have been able to build a metadata repository of RDF descriptions and a search interface which is capable of more sophisticated queries than less expressive object centric metadata models will allow Keywords Metadata Modeling Ontologies Acknowledgement The work described in this paper has been carried out within the Harmony International Digital Library Project It has been funded by NSF Grant JISC Grant and the Cooperative Research Centre for Enterprise Distributed Systems Technology DSTC through the Australian Federal
