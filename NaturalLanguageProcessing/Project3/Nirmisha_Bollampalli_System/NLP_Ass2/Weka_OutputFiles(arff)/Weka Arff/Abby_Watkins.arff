the age of with V boulder problems crack and sport routes and A nail ups to his credit He has been climbing for years and makes his home in Canada s granite destination Squamish BC When asked about his new route on Baffin Island Maddaloni says Our route in Baffin was BIG I m talking about to hour leads of hard and scary aid while living on the wall for days in a row That s enough time for the world to completely cease to exist You eat breathe and sleep climbing something I ve never seemed to attain even from a week long El Capitan route In Maddaloni soloed a foot tower in Pakistan I had never been to a third world country the Himalayas or soloed a big wall first ascent Pakistan seemed the perfect place to satisfy these curiosities Alone and exposed on a granite wall out in the Karakoram mountains left me looking deep into my psyche What I found was alarming and intense and I wanted more In the summer of Maddaloni had finished two new long routes The Black Dyke with pitches and it s crux at b had become Squamish s first all bolt protected multi pitch to the summit of the Chief His Warriors of the Wasteland with pitches was climbed completely ground up and included a meter a finger crack and a c sport pitch all bolted while on lead In commenting on these two very different styles of climbs Maddaloni says I m interested in all adventures and first ascents are guaranteed adventures because what lies ahead is all but a mystery To me this sounds like the most fun Matt s VIMFF multimedia presentation Squamish Long Free Routes will cover his recent breakthrough

bouldering From developing hundreds of boulder problems in Hueco Tanks climbing over thousand different boulder problems in his years long climbing career including early repeats of the rock climbing milestones of The Thimble and Midnight Lightning to developing the V V is for Verm bouldering grade designing the first commercially available crash pad The Kinnaloa Sketchpad to being a writer for Climbing Magazine John continues to push the envelope of high ball bouldering and society norms He has climbed in every state written profusely on everything from desert sandstone to bagging carpet strips at the base of boulders to the sexual dysfuction of climbing magazine editors He has also written three books Stone Crusade the Bible on the history and development of bouldering in America Sherman Exposed a slightly censored collection of his best and funniest stories and unfortunately prostituted himself with the self help book Better Bouldering for dorks who don t know better Verm is one of the bravest no holds barred funniest pull no punches journos that the climbing community has ever experienced He is a rare breed fat extremely good looking for a sheep shagger he can boulder quite well hates Christian Griffiths with Russ Walling and Dick Cilley and is a self promotor extraordinaire But at all times he must be treated with kid gloves His ego his joints and his tendons are fragile Verm on a boulderer getting old You don t worry so much about getting fat Especially when you find out that chicks half your age dig having something to grab on to The bummer is all the injuries coming back to haunt you Being an old boulderer is very painful However I don t plan to panic until my joints get stiffer than my johnson Verm on his favourite climbing model Laetitia Casta now there is finally something superb coming out of France I say the French invented pulling on gear and calling it freeclimbing I ll admit they played around on the boulders at Fontainebleau and guys like Pierre Allain did some cool stuff but I still credit John Gill with inventing modern bouldering He was the first to pursue bouldering as a gymnastic pursuit and to view the boulders as gymnastic apparatus He was also the first to actively seek out problems which could only be climbed dynamically On Sherman Exposed Outrageous talented and a force to be reckoned with John Sherman is always willing to spout an opinion that s sure to raise eyebrows This rowdy collection of biting satire parody profiles barely restrained rants and genuine reflections on climbing s unsung heroes is no different Blending his juiciest Verm s World columns from Climbing magazine with previously unpublished or perhaps unpublishable stories Sherman pulls no punches even on himself From his college exploits in buildering on the Berkeley c us to his quest for the Fab to his years as a nomadic boulderer Sherman shares the best and the worst he has found in the people and places he encountered along the way Climbers will discover valuable excuse making techniques in The Dog Ate My Belay Plate they will aspire to the very un PC All Vermin Team and they will challenge themselves with The Verm s World History Aptitude Test Who could ask for more On the recent news of Verm getting married My dog Thimble and I have shared a common address for years now that constitutes a common law marriage in Colorado It would be bigamy for me to marry another I suppose I could move to Utah Verm s famous bouldering scale V A problem you wouldn t admit to doing no matter how cool it was V A problem you would admit to doing if it had loose holds a death landing and your partner backed off of it V A problem if cool enough that you would recommend to others to prove you re not a ratings snob V A

flashing V A problem you knew you could have done even though your spotter took kg off for you so you counted it anyway V A problem if flashed that you might get free shoes for but only if you fax the

not so sore from training the sun not in your eyes and you didn t eat that funky take out Chinese the night before V A problem commensurate with your well published abilities that you deserve credit for even though you didn t do it because as the mags reported It was too humid V A problem only Fred Nicole could do after you gave him the beta Join Verm in his VIMFF show The Fab John Verm Sherman s preposterous quest to climb in all states en route experiencing the best and worst climbing the US has to offer It s about an hour long and follows Verm s quest to be first to rock climb in all states of the US Hence it explores the best and worst climbing America has to offer from the big walls of Yosemite to the sw s of Florida It s fairly tongue in cheek as such a quest is pretty ridiculous in

achievements first ascent on Everest in the winter with Leszek Cichy actually a first winter ascent of an thousander first ascent of a m peak in one day Broad Peak hours up and hours down solo a few new routes on the highest peaks many of them climbed solo first winter ascents of the highest peaks Everest Kangchenjunga and Lhotse Wielicki together with the famous Polish expedition leader Andrzej Zawada originated the idea of climbing in the Himalayas in the winter He also climbed the obligatory and so well medialized all fourteen thousanders as well as the highest peaks of each continent but then you in a way expect something like that from a stubborn Pole a proud member of the Art of Suffering movement Wielicki s list of climbing credentials with his meter peak notes may actually appear longer and to an outside observer more boring and drier than Adam Szienkiewicz s oeuvres all combined however a closer insight reveals a very passionate interesting personality Wielicki s Bildung in the Art of Suffering started at the early age During his first climbing season he crashed down and broke three of his lumbar vertebras At the clinic they stuffed him into a plaster corset up to his neck The only problem was his brother was getting married and their mother simply couldn t know that he was climbing at all not to mention the hospital his injury corset and all For his brother s wedding he had to be there and so he cut the plaster with a knife edge and escaped from the hospital through the balcony and roof His friends had brought him clothes and nobody discovered anything Many accidents followed but the will to climb was stronger Those climbing survival stories Wielicki s name is associated above all with the first winter ascent of Everest yet Wielicki got to the expedition from a reserve list For Andrzej Zawada the head of the expedition he was but a greenhorn he was only years old and this was his first major expedition to the high ranges The history of this expedition is fairly well known in short Wielicki reached the summit with Leszek Cichy Interestingly one could say that Wielicki started his Himalayan career from the rear end from the highest mountain in the most extreme conditions He was a member of Solidarnosc the Polish underground party escaping the officials destroying and hiding secret documents and being interrogated by the state police He went to Alaska and earned some decent money by working hard as a fish gutter That was his first contact with capitalism a really dreadful experience since it was the first time he had experienced fierce competition at the workplace Then there came a period of working at heights when there were two doctors and one assistant professor hanging on one chimney Wielicki painted almost the whole of his native Silesia To this day he shows his children where their daddy painted the Katowice steelworks mines buildings conveyor belts chimneys of heat generating plants water towers from Trzebnia to Zabrze Perhaps harder than climbing Everest in the winter capitalism and fighting with the state police was Wielicki s solo Nanga Parbat climb in After climbing K in the summer of he went on to solo Nanga Parbat directly afterwards He was all alone just him and the mountain This was when I was the most scared ever In the most recent years Wielicki was pushing for the first winter ascent of K making two notable attempts in and with a strong international team getting always quite high but never to the top In the vein of the great Polish romantic writers Wielicki secretly dreams about Polish climbers being the first people on all the world s highest peaks in the winter time Wielicki is a Renaissance man of the mountains any mountain any style solo or with friends any season home made cr ons or top gear you name it and Krzysztof can do it If he doesn t make it the first time you bet he be seen there one year later A man of amazing human strength both physical and mental Never stop climbing is his motto pushing on even when it hurts but also knowing when it is time to turn around I will never stop climbing because we should always try to make new and different goals this is the key for mountaineering Wielicki s VIMFF presentation will cover his life time journey of a world class alpine climber and mountaineer as well as many hair raising stories from his climbs

Nose of El Capitan and the Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome She has first ascents of Changi Tower m and Marpo Brakk m in the Karakoram She is an X Games medal winner speed and took first place at Festiglace du Quebec ice climbing Abby s desire to work doing what she loves and to spread the joy she receives from climbing prompted her to start guiding During the summer of she was a guide for Jackson Hole Mountain Guides With her husband Rich Marshall Abby works as an independent guide in their business Mountain Guiding She is co owner of Ascending Women a women only guiding school which she founded with fellow professional climber Kim Czismasia She is an ACMG Association of Canadian Mountain Guides certified guide a Wilderness First Responder and has a CAA Level Avalanche certification Before moving to the states Abby was a member of the Australian National Gymnastics team a sport for which she received a full athletic scholarship to U C Berkeley in She is the recipient of the Mask and Dagger Prize for extraordinary contributions to Dramatic Art dance and she regularly publishes articles in climbing publications in the U S Australia and Europe Abby s also an animal lover she saved the life of a dog that fell of the top of a cliff where she was climbing She has been working in the outdoors for years In Her Own Words The Job As a mountain guide my job is varied and full I am currently making my way through the ACMG mountain guide s exams which entails exams over about years and will cost a total of about to become a fully certified mountain guide This summer I will be both guiding and practicing my guiding skills in order to pass the guide s exam This means getting into the alpine as much as possible even if the weather is not as good as it could be For ex le yesterday my husband and I climbed the northeast Ridge of Mt Athabasca in the Canadian Rockies in a white out I led the day as if I was guiding while Rich acted as my client and examiner Rich is a fully certified UIAGM guide who examines for the ACMG I enjoyed the challenge of route finding with no visibility it s good to put yourself into situations like that so that you can be calm and practiced when such situations present themselves spontaneously I will also be guiding private clients this summer on multi pitch rock routes and mountaineering I am putting together a women s rock clinic through Ascending Women which entails gathering a great group of guides Some of the most accomplished and highly certified women guides in Canada have agreed to be a part of it Putting together clinics takes quite a bit of organization so that they run smoothly when the day comes Because I mostly work for myself I need to be highly motivated creative and organized in order to keep the business going but I also enjoy the freedom and variation I can bring to my life and work so it s worth it How She Got There I started climbing while I was at university at U C Berkeley I began to work at Cal Adventures U C Berkeley s outdoor adventure department a year after I started climbing This brought some institutional knowledge to my fledgling skills and really put me on the right track technically Since then I have worked for many outdoor companies guide services and climbing gyms I ve also created my own work within those frameworks travelling with a climbing technique clinic private climbing coaching writing operation manuals and training staff in newly opened climbing gyms etc I did not take intellectual steps so to speak to get where I am now I simply followed my love of the mountains and the outdoors The work followed The years I put into climbing simply because that was what I loved and wanted to do have paid off in the mountain knowledge and skills I have now How to Get Her Job To become a mountain guide one must first develop mountain sense which only comes from climbing and skiing in the mountains for many years in many different mountain ranges Only then can you approach the guide s exams I am enjoying the process of certification because it really makes me focus on my skills and knowledge I also love learning from mountain guides who have been guiding for or years you can t buy that kind of experience You have to love people to be a mountain guide or any kind of guide A guide must be able to interpret the medium they are intimate with in such a way that the clients feel like they are a part of the process not a lump on the end of the rope The mountain guide must be interested in people from all walks of life and in sharing full and often tiring days with all kinds of folk Guides have endless patience and love to see people discover their capabilities and to achieve things they thought they couldn t Guides also must explain to the clients the difference between safe conditions and the kind of conditions where you have to turn around Pros Being outside in all elements meeting people from all over the world Cons Long stints away from home can be stressful on relationships but can also be good if there is a balance some time away but lots of time together Salary Range Fully certified mountain guides in Canada make per day depending on what they are guiding and if they are guiding for themselves or contracting for a company although in the States one must be an employee of a company in order to guide under the current rules which makes the pay lower and the variety of what you are guiding diminish Her Dream Job Doing what I m doing Do you think there s any danger in your passion becoming your career As long as you keep variety in what you are guiding easy in Canada where the seasons affect what you are guiding from rock to alpine to ice to ski touring Also guiding independently possible in UIAGM countries such as Canada allows you to keep variety in what you are guiding I also like to keep other ways of earning money alongside what I do like writing studying biology teaching dance and practicing yoga Return

'CBC CA The National Worst case scenario Avalanche kills seven teens in B C backcountry Reporter Margo McDiarmid February On February seven Calgary families learned of the deaths of their teenage children and an entire country grieved with them Scott Broshko Marissa Staddon Ben Albert Daniel Arato Alex Patillo Michael Shaw and Jeff Trickett were killed during a high school ski trip swept to their deaths by a massive avalanche It was an unimaginable tragedy both for the parents who saw their children off that fateful day and for the people who tried desperately to rescue them It all started on a Friday morning in a Calgary parking lot Three teachers and students embarked on the school trip they had been looking forward to backcountry skiing Scott Broshko Donna Broshko s son Scott was among the group They were just so excited and happy to go she says It sounded like they were just going to have the time of their lives It was just another one of the trips right You know it was Have fun Love you You know that kind of stuff right But never I wasn t really ever thinking any grave potential danger I mean trust me if it would ve been you know mama bear would ve never let him go A young Marissa Staddon Karl Staddon described his daughter Marissa Marissa was bubbly and upbeat and she had on her red bibbed ski pants and had on her Gore Tex red Gore Tex top and her green pack and we drove over to the Canadian Tire on Richmond Road he said I got to tell you that my wife when we left our house she stood at the doorway to the garage and was very concerned and was tearing up because of just concerns about safety he said Marissa gave me a big hug and nestled her head against my neck and said Dad I love you And I said Marissa I love you too And I said have a great trip And that was the last time I saw her alive The skiers went to British Columbia s Glacier National Park one of the most popular places in the world for backcountry adventure Enthusiasts can trek up trails into the steep mountains and bowls of untouched snow It s a skier s paradise It s also avalanche country The students and their teachers knew that and trained for it What they didn t know was that they were about to ski into the worst case scenario Marissa gave me a big hug and nestled her head against my neck and said Dad I love you Rick Marshall Saturday morning was day two of the trip and the group headed up a popular trail into a mountain valley There were a number of other skiers in the area that day Rick Marshall was one of them I think it was probably around or something like that when we left the car and headed up the Connaught Creek drainage he said And we were you know there s a few people ahead of us we realized on the trail and you know we started passing a few groups and some groups were going off into another drainage to ski and they came across the school group and passed them he said We just started off from our break We noticed an avalanche coming down off the north face of Mount Cheops and that s when we realized that there was you know a good group of skiers was below in the path of it he said We actually yelled to them that there was an avalanche coming down off of Cheops said Marshall We actually witnessed the avalanche hit a couple of the front members of the group Abby Watkins Abby Watkins also saw the avalanche Within seconds I had the realization that it was going to be very big she said I had a question as to whether we were safe because we were straight across from it And then we just braced for what was going to happen And then we were hit by the powder cloud said Watkins Right off the bat I could see that there were people caught in it said Marshall And then you know I saw a hand sticking out and you know a leg further over and somebody partially buried There was little chance that I could save everybody said Watkins You just have to save as many people as possible There was little chance that I could save everybody said Watkins You just have to save as many people as possible Within an hour seven helicopters people and three search dogs were on the scene But Rick Marshall got there first I went to the person with the hand sticking out he said That just happened to be Andrew the group leader and he had a cellphone on him not a cellphone but a satellite phone and so we radioed Parks personnel Eric Dafoe Eric Dafoe was avalanche rescue commander that day I got the call from dispatch in Rogers Pass and said you re going to work he said My initial reaction was this is really serious and we ve got to act quickly Dafoe met Jordy Shepherd an avalanche site rescue leader and they flew to the scene by helicopter This was our worst case scenario said Shepherd A large natural avalanche in a busy area that hit a large group That type of dry slab avalanche can generally reach speeds of to kilometres an hour and it actually pushes a pillow of wind in front of it Sylvain Hebert Sylvain Hebert a heli ski guide and rescuer was skiing nearby at the time of the avalanche I had just been dropped off on top of a run and I d skied maybe turns and I got a call on the radio from our radio dispatch telling me that there was an avalanche at Rogers Pass and that they needed our help he said I just grabbed the shovel and shovelled as well Jordy Shepherd Shepherd and Dafoe credit a number of guides including Hebert Marshall and Watkins with rescuing several of the victims Watkins and Marshall were probably responsible for saving five people s lives said Dafoe Marshall said he had no choice but to act quickly A slide that powerful and with that kind of snow density you know you only have five minutes he said There were no air pockets in the snow You re just holding your breath Marshall said some victims were conscious and some were not In a situation like that you just you give er and you don t stop he said You re on adrenalin and you know you dig hard and you search hard and you just try and get the job done as fast as you can Watkins said it was difficult to deal with the fact that some of the teens weren t alive when they got to them Every face I saw like that I realized that there was a family attached that this was going to devastate that family she said As the rescue progressed the winds picked up and conditions turned dangerous Marshall said he and the other rescuers worried another avalanche would hit them We were a little concerned you know why this avalanche started he said The winds were a little higher now and we were concerned for our own safety as well The rescuers beat an orderly retreat Our world had stopped Donna Broshko remembered how she heard about the avalanche I m going out the back way out the garage door and the phone rings and it s the headmaster from school and he said Donna there s been an accident I said OK well is everybody okay And he says Oh no unfortunately not I say well what do you mean unfortunately not Or something like that And he said Well there s been some fatalities And he says Oh there s been such a tragedy And I was like cut to the chase Like I ve had enough waiting Like I just no more peripheral stuff like just tell me how Scott is He says I m really sorry he s one of the victims Well that was like it was like phenomenal It was like like just such disbelief Just no no Just no Just no Karl Staddon Karl Staddon also got the call I asked for the RCMP s number in Revelstoke which he provided to me he said And so I called and I spoke with Officer Sommerville who also was very gracious And he I told him who I was I was the father of one of the students involved in the trip I understand there s been an avalanche and wondered if he could fill me in And then he paused and he said you should brace yourself for the worst possible outcome And my heart about leapt out of my chest And then he went on to say and again with great compassion and care he said that there are nine students that are accounted for or alive and accounted for Your daughter is not on that list But we cannot say with per cent certainty that she s deceased at this stage he said We were numbed to be honest said Staddon Truly numbed Just could not believe it Our world had stopped Janice Pinkerton As the families struggled to cope with the tragedy Revelstoke resident Janice Pinkerton a member of Revelstoke Victims Services opened her home to the survivors A lot of them had bangs in their faces and their ears and they didn t look like they had been they were wounded but they were definitely hurt she said And they talked about hotels and that and that didn t strike me that struck me wrong So I said that I had a house that was more than big enough and I m sure I could find enough blankets and sleeping bags and beds and they could sleep there she said The memory I ll have is their faces their ears because they had a lot of them had like swollen faces she said And how they huddled How they were always together And they it was almost like they moved as a group and I thought that that was that was very powerful to me that they were so so focused on each other she said In Calgary normal life stopped Seven funerals in less than a week The city ran out of flowers Donna Broshko At her son Scott s funeral Donna Broshko carried his ashes in an urn I thought I m his mother I carried him for nine months I can carry him out I can do this you know And I did it I just I can do this right It s something you can do for your child right Karl Staddon reflected on the funeral for his daughter Marissa When I wrote the funeral card I looked at some of the other cards and you know people live to be or and years seemed so incredibly short he said And I did the math and Marissa was with us for days That sounded better And they were glorious days Strathcona Tweedsmuir School launched an investigation into the tragic school trip and it is reviewing its outdoor education program that is the cornerstone of the private school s philosophy In the meantime all other school trips are cancelled Donna Broshko says she doesn t blame the school for her son s death In my heart I believe that they did do everything that they could do you know Sometimes things happen in life right Sometimes things happen in life right Staddon agrees I m at peace with the decision making by the trip leaders that particular day he said And I m satisfied that this is a very rare occurrence of this magnitude that involved a school group Jordy Shepherd said that the group did everything right This group was they were very well prepared and and it was an unfortunate circumstance that they were they were there at that time he said But the four seconds that wiped out seven young lives will leave lasting scars not just on the school and the families but also on the people who fought to save the skiers and the B C community that poured its heart out to the survivors Watch part one of Margo McDiarmid s report runs Watch part two of Margo

'Gripped News gt gt June July World News The Machine Spanish climber Ram oacute n Juli aacute n Puigblanque has been described by Steve McClure as just a climbing machine a block of muscle with technique thrown in unfairly Puigblanque has spent this spring climbing on rock before his focus turns to the upcoming World Cup season and the world of plastic His performance should serve as a warning shot to his rivals Arriving in Siurana Spain after a winter s training the Spaniard quickly polished off two longstanding projects Puigblanque warmed up by sending Chikane c in six tries a project bolted years ago but which has repelled all previous attempts at redpoint Next up was an old project of Dani Andrada a line parallel to La Rambla Estado Critico a m route with long moves on bad crimps gave Puigblanque a bit more trouble requiring approximately attempts for the redpoint Puigblanque feels Estado Critico to be d and the second hardest route in the area just after his own La Rambla extension Slab Technician Bain De Sang d at St Loup Switzerland has been repeated by Italian Alessandro Lamberti According to Lamberti the near vertical route with very technical climbing and a boulder problem crux at the top required much more fine tuning and co ordination it has to be climbed much more serenely and with less rage an approach in marked contrast to other high end steep sport routes he has done Lamberti is unsure of the grade of Bain De Sang but feels that the V boulder crux which arrives at the end combined with the lack of fast repeats pushes Bain De Sang beyond the realm of c V Trade Route In the three years since Fred Nicole s Dream Time V at Cresciano was established the problem has gone from being the world s most difficult to a journeyman problem albeit a journeyman problem for the world s elite This spring saw ascents by Italian Mauro Calibani and American James Litz Amid all the ascents come charges of chipping and manipulation from none other then Fred Nicole Nicole states that Cresciano and Dreamtime in particular has fallen victim to over enthusiastic cleaning with steel brushes and said some must have used more than a brush However Malcolm Smith a recent ascensionist has countered that he has tried this problem on a number of occasions since its first ascent and I think if there are changes then they must be very subtle indeed I have not noticed a marked difference in the size of the holds or the difficulty of the problem Smith also stated that I think that what can happen over years and after thousands of brushings and hands is that the holds can change organically McClure Becomes Grit s Elder Statesman Briton Steve McClure best known for his cutting edge sport routes has turned his attention toward gritstone and its associated traditional ethos The result is Elder Statesman the ar ecirc te to the left of Elder Crack a longstanding last great line that has rebuffed the efforts of many of Britain s best climbers The line starts via the original crack and launches out on to the ar ecirc te at three quarter height McClure gains an edge near the corner via a heel toe cam in the crack putting him in a fully horizontal position before launching out around the corner in a violent swing to latch a bad hold on the face and easier ground McClure hesitates to assign a grade citing his inexperience with gritstone grades but the route is likely to be at least E which translated to a or harder trad line b Onsight Spanish climber Patxi Usobiaga has shown he is in fine onsighting form for the upcoming season with a week long spree in Alquezar and Laroanna Spain Usobiaga kicked things off with an onsight of B rated at a b and Desafiendo Newton a Then proceeded to link Desafiendo Newton with Tsunami b a route he had done previously Impressively Usobiaga completed the linkage on his first attempt to produce Desafiendo Tsunami c d If the rating of B eventually settles at b it will stand as the first b onsight _Andre Cheuk return to top News Smith Rocks Trad Redux Torontonian Sonnie Trotter recently tested his personal limits on the run out Smith Rock classic East Face c d FA Alan Watts The route follows a m crack line and has five bolts a belay station and one fixed piton for protection According to the Smith guide book the route still awaited its first true redpoint almost years after the first ascent Trotter stoked on trad climbs as of late intended to clean the route without clipping any fixed gear Because the route has meagre protection and requires a mandatory runout section at the crux it s rarely attempted My first attempt on lead I took a sweet footer described Trotter It was awesome but a heartbreaker I had only two more moves to go I found it very difficult to place protection while right in the middle of the cruxy bulging sections It took Trotter seven days over two weeks before he put the sequence together In mid April he sent the route It was positively one of my most rewarding climbing moments It was for sure a huge step above You Must Be High in Eldo Referring to a c d R X route he recently climbed Discussing his rev ed fervour for trad climbing Totter claimed that he looks forward to trying other desperately hard climbs on clean gear It just feels right to do things this way Festiglace The North Face du Qu eacute bec On February th to nd the seventh annual Festiglace The North Face du Qu eacute bec was held in Pont Rouge The ice climbing took place in the Ile de Raisin Canyon a spot considered by many to be among the top five ice destinations in the world The competition featured top climbers Guy Lacelle Will Gadd and Abby Watkins in the team speed and mixed events This year s Festiglace drew an excellent turnout from both competitors and spectators Evening entertainment included slide shows by Gadd Sean Isaac and J eacute r ocirc me Blanc Gras The Adidas amateur speed climbing event was a spectator favourite featuring top rock climbers like Nick Sagar trying their hand in this icy medium Gadd St eacute phane Lapointe and J eacute r ocirc me Blancgras were the top three respectively in the men s speed competition while Abby Watkins Audrey Gari eacute py and Myriam St Louis finished one two three in the women s event _Chris Lepik Rockies Mixed Euro Onslaught With the cancellation of this winter s Ice World Cup many of Europe s top mixed climbers made the journey across the Atlantic to attend the Canmore Ice Climbing Festival and Kayland Cup Competition as well as s le the Canadian Rockies renowned mixed testpieces As one local sarcastically pointed out The Cineplex was the Ice World Cup this year The main action was centred on Ben Firth s latest creation The Game M now heralded as the toughest in the world First on the scene was Harry Berger Austria who made a semi repeat of The Game by doing the first roof crux then unknowingly finished up on the last half of the parallel Rocky Mountain Horror Show M instead of its proper finish which is slightly harder Israel Blanco Spain made the true second ascent He overcame the crux dyno with cunning by leaving his heel spur hooked on the tool he launched from in order to make the span He then proceeded to release his lower tool with his feet and bring it up to his hand while dangling by one tool Mauro Bubu Bole Italy made the third ascent but being much shorter than the giant Firth he had to add cm extensions to his axes to make the crux reach Regarding these tactics Firth quips It s all part of the game Evgeny Kirovshetsev Ukraine went on to make a fourth repeat Mixed climbing is evolving at such a breakneck pace that routes like Musashi originally M and only a year ago considered the hardest in the world saw stacks of ascents This m horizontal challenge saw over repeats including its first flash by Blanco and first female ascent by Anna Toretta Italy Other European uber climbers also made rapid repeats including Kurt Astner Italy Herbert Bole Kirovshetsev Chris Cubbet England Ines Papert Germany and Scott Muir Scotland Rocky Mountain Horror Show originally M beside Musashi also saw a flurry of traffic The crux slot has widened creating a very technical torque and making it substantially harder than when originally climbed It saw redpoints by Kirovshetsev and Roger Strong of the USA as well as an onsight ascent by Bole becoming the hardest onsight of a mixed route to date On the local front Sean Isaac of Canmore sent both Rocky Mountain Horror Show and Musashi Along with Isaac Kirovshetsev and Bole are the only other two people this year to repeat both All three believe that RHMS is definitely the harder of the two Musashi has gotten easier with traffic the holds are more positive from picks digging in while RMHS has become harder Having repeated these two testpieces Isaac believes that his and Dave Thomson s Stanley Headwall route Phyllis Diller originally graded M and unrepeated is in retrospect much harder and probably closer to M when compared to the Cineplex routes In the Hoar House Cave at the back of Haffner Creek Joe Buszowski established Neolithic M besides Isaac s roof and log contrivance Caveman M Like its neighbour Neolithic has absolutely no ice but makes up for this with difficulty Berger made the second ascent in four tries confirming the grade Now in his mid s Buszowski is in his mixed climbing prime He has witnessed the evolution of the sport since his first ascent of the classic Mixed Master with Troy Kirwan in Caveman also received its first flash ascent by Calgary strongman Mike Charbonneau Besides the hard sends by visiting climbers local activists have been hard at work establishing more mixed classics The second edition of Mixed Climbs in the Canadian Rockies came out in January and there are already over new routes many of which are of the traditionally protected variety _Sean Isaac North Face of The North Twin Climbed Again Steve House and Marko Prezelj recently made the coveted third ascent up the north face of The North Twin Their mixed route sits between the two now infamous routes on the Twin the unrepeated Lowe Jones and Blanchard Cheesmond routes The ascent is the third time in years the North Twin has been climbed successfully In spite of a minor catastrophe during their third bivy in which House managed to drop his outer right boot the twosome worked their way up the m headwall House was forced to second with a single boot but managed to attach his right cr on to his inner liner Prezelj led the final pitches before the duo were forced to bivi just shy of the summit on April th _Mark Cohen Drytoolers Blitz Rockies Alpine Between February Ben Firth and Raphael Slawinski made the first winter ascent of the Greenwood Locke route on the north face of Mt Temple V A in the summer m M in the winter On day one the duo skied in soloed up the Dolphin couloir then climbed five rope lengths on the headwall before pitching their Bibler over a snow flute Firth and Slawinski freed the remaining six pitches of drytooling on day two According to Slawinski the route had seen previous winter attempts none of them successful Sean Dougherty Jeff Marshall Chris Geisler and the late Guy Edwards all attempted the route Dougherty himself put in four separate attempts As for our climb said Slawinski the difference between it and the previous attempts and perhaps also what tipped the scales in our favour was our extensive drytooling experience both on bolted mixed climbs and on more traditional routes We drytooled the difficult section of the route for no other reason than it was the easiest and fastest way to go about things A month later Slawinski returned to Temple with Russian Valery Babinov who recently immigrated to Canada to climb The Sphinx Face V A a route first done in by Ward Robinson and Rob Orvig Slawinski and Babinov climbed the route and drytooled their way through the route s difficult M sections Unfortunately they were forced to descend shy of the summit because of deteriorating conditions The Greenwood Locke route first climbed in is considered a Rockies alpine classic The route offers the least hazardous most technical climbing on the north face of Temple It sits to the right of the easier but slightly more committing Elzinga Miller summer route that s seen a minimum of three winter ascents _Mark Cohen return to top Got News Did you redpoint your first or finally nail that V We are looking for your news cause lets face it not all of us can climb Well don t

'Avalanche Incident CSAC Canada February Avalanche Incident Season Date Location Activity Killed Injured Bulletin Feb Canada Skiing minor Photos Media Reports Official Reports Other Sources Photos Topo Map segment showing location in relation to Hwy and Rogers Pass Newspaper photo of slide area and slide runout Media Reports Seven skiers dead in second deadly B C avalanche in a month REVELSTOKE B C CP Seven teens on a high school ski excursion in the back country of east central B C died Saturday when a half kilometre wide avalanche came down from above them and engulfed their group It was the second deadly slide to hit the region in as many weeks Seven adults perished in a slide in January The dead were six boys and one girl all in Grade at Strathcona Tweedsmuir School a private day school on an expansive rural c us in the foothills southwest of Calgary We are absolutely stricken with grief Our hearts go out to all those who are impacted Tony Macoun head of the school said in a written statement Frantic parents gathered at the school Saturday night arriving separately and in groups embracing each other No students were visible Our school is a small family and loss this extreme is impacting us tremendously said Macoun There were people in the school group three adults and Grade students in an outdoor education class on their annual cross country ski trip The avalanche occurred on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park just before noon said Pam Doyle superintendent for Parks Canada in Revelstoke It happened on the north face of the mountain in Connaught Creek Valley section of Balu Valley about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit The group was led by two male teachers and a male volunteer All had certification and back country experience Macoun said The group had been skiing about metres apart with one supervisor in front and the other two bringing up the rear The skiers were halfway up the valley when the avalanche roared down the north slope burying nearly the entire group Another group of young skiers witnessed the avalanche and were among the first to help A supervisor whose hand was just visible above the snow was the first to be dug out Once freed he called park wardens on a satellite phone to raise the alarm Of the remaining students six of the students are safe and one has a broken ankle Macoun said in his statement The three leaders were uninjured and are attending to the survivors who were in Revelstoke on Saturday night after being airlifted first to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter Two people from the group were treated for minor injuries said RCMP Sgt Randy Brown The avalanche was very powerful with a rating from to compared with a top rating of said Pat Dunn a Parks Canada spokeswoman The size to avalanche could destroy a building or acres of forest she said The slide was to metres wide and travelled a kilometre down the slope Some of the skiers were buried as deep as three metres said Dunn She said the group was carrying the proper avalanche rescue equipment including personal locator beacons and digging tools A park conditions bulletin said there was a considerable avalanche hazard in the area Saturday That rating is about the middle of the hazard scale but includes the high probability that a person could trigger a slide said Dunn The risk always varies when the risk is posted as considerable it s a note to skiers to be cautious she said There are a couple of instabilities in our snow pack this winter that may have contributed and further investigation will determine that Saturday s slide was unusually deadly said Eric Dafoe public safety officer with Parks Canada in Revelstoke We ve never had an avalanche like this where we had a multiple number of people buried said Dafoe who worked on the rescue effort and flew over the slide as part the initial investigation It was a huge slide he said It covered the valley floor from side to side Dafoe said the slide began at a point between to vertical metres up Mount Cheops It travelled for a kilometre and spread out half a kilometre at the sides The toe of the slide ended at about the metre elevation mark with parts of it more than five metres deep Dafoe said the investigation will continue but was almost certain it was a natural slide It the slide trigger site is so far from the bottom it seems unlikely it was human triggered he said Dafoe speculated a small slide may have occurred high up the mountain and as it came down it dragged out snow from surrounding gullies Park wardens RCMP officers and local ski tour operators and guides backed up by four or five helicopters and search dogs joined in the rescue effort Members of a Canadian Horse Artillery unit stationed in the park for avalanche control work were also on hand to assist Ruedi Beglinger owner of Selkirk Mountain Experience and organizer of the fatal expedition last month was with his clients when it struck Contacted Saturday night Beglinger did not want to comment on the level of experience necessary to ski the area where the students were caught There is an inherent risk in back country skiing which is very important to talk about an inherent risk people have to be willing to share amongst themselves whether they have a guide or not he said The area of Saturday s slide is not particularly remote but Dunn said there were no groomed trails except people who have been there before you But no guides are needed to ski in the area and skiers do not have to register before setting off It s a very very popular ski destination site said Dunn media liaison officer at the national park Brown said the skiers were not part of a commercial tour group Doyle said that at this time there are no plans yet to close back country areas of the park Official Reports Avalanche Tragedy in Glacier National Park by Doreen McGillis Parks Canada Published in the Avalanche News of the Canadian Avalanche Association On February a huge avalanche swept into the Connaught Creek drainage of Glacier National Park and into the awareness of millions of Canadians This avalanche accident attracted the attention of the nation The seven victims of this avalanche were year olds on a school field trip and the accident happened less than two weeks after an avalanche that killed seven skiers in an area only kilometres away All skiers in the school group were caught in this avalanche either partially or fully buried and survived Two Association of Canadian Mountain Guides ACMG members were above this party heard and saw the avalanche across the valley and tried to warn the group but the avalanche hit them so fast they were unable to get to safety The rescuers Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall immediately skied down to the slide area and started to dig out those buried The first person that they dug out called for help on his satellite phone which mobilized a large rescue team Then as members of the group were freed from the slide they helped dig out the others Upon hearing the number of people who were caught in this avalanche the rescuers wondered how so many could be involved Their answer came when they flew to the scene of the avalanche It was huge The fracture zone was about metres wide and the run out was more than a kilometre long The size of the rescue operation was also huge more than people seven helicopters six avalanche dogs and their handlers and dozens of support staff were involved This was a multi agency rescue involving Parks Canada staff from three national parks several local companies Selkirk Tangiers Helicopter Skiing Canadian Mountain Holidays Selkirk Mountain Experience Alpine Helicopters Kokanee Helicopters Shell Canada Revelstoke Executive Flight Services mountain guides RCMP tourists medical staff and the Canadian Army stationed at Rogers Pass Important services provided during the rescue included grief counseling support to the families media relations transportation and logistical support Participating in such a difficult situation is very stressful It is tragic that seven young people lost their lives in the accident and the people of Revelstoke and Golden have shared this grief The speedy rescue helped save the lives of the remaining people in the group and to quickly recover the victims The credit for the speed and efficiency of the entire rescue effort can be shared among all of those who participated in this rescue Times such as these show how public safety professionals and volunteers truly rise to the occasion when called upon The staff and management of Mount Revelstoke and Glacier National Parks would like to offer our gratitude and appreciation to all of the individuals who took part in the rescue efforts following the tragic avalanche of February Steve

'Winter Hazards Avalanche What is an Avalanche Snow is deposited in successive layers as the winter progresses These layers may have dissimilar physical properties and an avalanche occurs when one layer slides on another Surface Avalanche or the whole snow cover slides on the ground Full Depth An avalanche may be Dry or Wet according to whether free water is present in the snow It may be of Loose Snow when the avalanche starts at a single point or a Slab Avalanche which occurs when an area of more cohesive snow separates from the surrounding snow and slides out They Couldn t Get Out of the Way By the time they wake Saturday morning Parks Canada will have already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountry skiers In tree line and alpine areas the avalanche risk has been assessed as considerable the mid range of the five possible ratings Below the tree line the risk is assessed as moderate with natural avalanches unlikely And the group of high school students and three adults intend to stay below the tree line throughout their expedition But the bulletin also refers to weak snow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failed to stabilize The group makes its way to the Rogers Pass information building a macaroni shaped structure with a sod and timber roof to pore over the latest information Mr Nicholson goes inside He asks about conditions in several areas before heading back to the students and two o ther adults a fellow teacher and a chaperone The group decides it is safe to ski that day They ski through forest along a rocky creek over a snow covered bridge and into the Connaught Creek valley Surrounded by mountains and deep powder snow the scenery is breathtaking Reminders of past avalanches are everywhere Foliage is sparse on the valley floor The school group successfully crosses four avalanche prone paths on the north side of the valley and three on the south side It s a soft grey morning The ground is blanketed by eight centimetres of fresh snow The temperature hovers around zero The past hours have been avalanche free and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountry skiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass in eastern British Columbia They are not alone The mountain guides spot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popular Balu Pass Husband and wife pause to say hello It s a beautiful day out here isn t it says Abby Yes someone responds They leave the teenagers and three adults behind climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treed area At that very moment just before noon something gives way on the rugged north face of Cheops Mountain Abby and Rich hear a thundero us roar They watch in horror as a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley picking up speed and debris The school group is directly in its path Rich screams Avalanche Avalanche Avalanche The skiers look up The guide s frantic warning comes too late The avalanche hits them head on In a matter of seconds all skiers are swept away in a huge terrifying tangle of snow rocks and trees The swiftness and power of the avalanche sounds like a freight train moving at high speeds Abby thinks A huge roar The power of that much snow moving at the acceleration of gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way Nobody could have got out of the way Nobody Students mourn the loss of their friends Th e river rush of snow engulfs the skiers then separates them A section of the slide breaks away and keeps going carrying a number of victims hundreds of metres down the valley Disoriented and tumbling head over foot with little chance to swim to the surface this unlucky group ends up as much as metres beneath the concrete hard snow Up in the trees Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are dusted by a thick cloud of powder A terrible silence falls over the valley Though their hearts are thumping they shut down their emotions On goes the search and rescue switch one they have trained for years to put into practice They race down to the first group of buried skiers The only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legs poking through the snow The others in the toe of the slide at the bottom of the valley are buried much deeper Alone at the scene the husband and wife team is faced with heartbreaking decisions Who to save first Not everybody would make it they reason But those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival Rich runs for the first hand he sees and begins digging For the next minutes except for the victims Rich and Abby are there by themselves working to free as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow The guides transceivers work perfectly honing in with beeps and flashing lights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons like shouts from the grave The couple follows the rules of avalanche rescue like clockwork Only dig to a victim to make sure he or she is breathing Clear snow from the victim s face No CPR before moving on to the next victim There are too many Let survivors dig themselves out The victims are scattered beneath the snow Rich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible The first five people they pull out survive Those survivors go on to rescue others Everyone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead The grim lottery of who shall live and who shall die is over Seven students make it Seven do not One survivor with a broken ankle is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital The remaining survivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the park warden s station The bodies go too They are laid out on mats in a makeshift morgue in the same building Chuck Purse Revelstoke s part time coroner is investigating his second seven death avalanche within two weeks He examines each body in turn None show signs of major injury They were simply swept away buried and died from asphyxiation Loose snow tumbles down the mountain A slab avalanche breaks off the mountain A car is swept away by a tidal wave of snow What Do I Do If I GET CAUGHT In most avalanche situations any defensive action is very difficult Movement relative to the debris is often impossible However some of the following may be useful Try to delay departure by plunging an ice axe into the undersurface This may help to keep you near the top of the slide Shout Others may see you Try to run to the side or jump up slope above the fracture If hard slab try to remain on top of a block Get rid of gear sacks skis etc Try to roll like a log off the debris Swimming motions sometimes help As the avalanche slows down you may be able to get some purchase on the debris Make a desperate effort to get to the surface or at least get a hand through I M BURIED Keep one hand in front of you face and try to clear maintain an air space Try to maintain space for chest expansion by taking and holding a deep breath Try to avoid panic and conserve energy Your companions are probably searching for you Try to dig yourself out if you are unhurt The next number that works against you is the length of burial A speedy location and recovery of the buried victim is essential as the survival rate drops to after minutes An avalanche occurs on Mt Everest A mountain climber treads carefully Skiiers are particularly vulnerable to triggering an avalanche as the lateral motion releases unstable snow Avalanche Rescue Equipment The best strategy for surviving an avalanche is to avoid being caught in one All backcountry skiers and boarders should be trained in avalanche awareness and should be knowledgeable about the conditions and terrain they re entering The following rescue equipment should be in everyone s backpack and the skills for using it should be readily accessible in everyone s head Transceivers Avalanche transceivers also known as beacons are designed to help a rescuer locate a buried victim in the least amount of time possible Although most beacons in use today are fairly intuitive to operate it is important to practice using them on a regular basis Probes The only way to penetrate dense compacted avalanche debris is to use a multi sectioned aluminium pole known as an avalanche probe They extend two to three metres long and are held in tension with a cable When a searcher with a beacon has honed in on a buried person other members of the party should probe the snowpack for the exact location of the victim You cannot pinpoint a person who is deeply buried using only a beacon The probe is left in contact with the victim until they have been exposed by shovelling Probes also have other uses such as checking snowpack depth and testing crevasse bridges and cornices while travelling For this reason they are currently carried by most travellers and are recommended over probe poles Shovels Finding the location of a victim is only the first part of the rescue digging them out is the second critical step In the seconds after an avalanche even fresh powder will solidify so densely that you cannot push your hand into it There are many different types of avalanche shovels The more high tech models have telescoping handles that extend to give better leverage when shovelling Some store saws or probes in their handles Metal blades chop debris better than lexan or polycarbonate and the bigger the blade the more snow you can move with each scoop The important thing about shovels is that everybody in your group has one It is also worth practising excavation in a team of two or three to learn to shovel effectively as a group Beautiful Roger s Pass B C is the site of a tragic accident that claimed the lives of students Avalanches claimed the lives of Canadians in That number declined in to fatalities Sliding Into Oblivion Former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau s youngest son Michel was killed in an avalanche in No one knows how quickly Michel Trudeau realized he was going to die Nov when a wall of wet snow sent him tumbling down a southern B C mountainside into ice cold Kokanee Lake A springtime view of Kokanee Lake where Michel still rests The youngest son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau spent several minutes in the water fighting to remove his heavy backpack and touring skis all the while shouting for help and groaning eyewitness Eric Lemieux told reporters later We could see him said Lemieux one of several skiers following Trudeau when the avalanche struck We knew it was going to be a slow and painful death But we couldn t reach him He was in the middle of the lake Trudeau eventually sank out of sight leaving behind one of Canada s most famous families to grieve without a casket Scuba divers have failed to find Trudeau s body in the glacier fed lake in Kootenay Glacier Provincial Park about kilometres southwest of Calgary The Trudeaus did not push search and rescue teams to locate Michel s body Says Justin Trudeau Michel s older brother of his final resting place in Kokanee Lake It s glorious It s one of the most beautiful places I ve ever seen That s where he was destined to be Trudeau had lived in the area for a year working as a ski lift attendant at Red Mountain near Rossland He was a fun loving young man who enjoyed the outdoors and had traveled out West after graduating from university Since Michel s death the Trudeau family has been working closely with the Canadian Avalanche Association to promote avalanche safety Young Michel with his famous father Michel with his best buddy Makwa the summer before his death In The Wrong Place at The Wrong Time A New H shire man was killed on November after he triggered an avalanche on the upper mountain of a closed ski area in Utah Jeff Clement was snowboarding with four friends in Little Cottonwood Canyon between the Alta and Snowbird ski areas when the incident occurred It was reported that he was the last to start down and he s the one who broke it loose Captain Gil Howard of the Salt Lake Country Sheriff s Office said It was a way unstable area The problem was they were in a ski area but they were faced with backcountry conditions Sgt Gil Howard Salt Lake County Sheriff s Office All five were buried to one extent or another Howard said and he was the only one completely buried The other four were able to extract themselves but Clement was buried with his board uphill Carrying no beacons or shovels the friends reportedly did everything they could to locate Clement but were unsuccessful Clement s body was found by an Alta rescue dog but a heavy storm predicted for the area Saturday night forced rescuers to abandon the recovery effort Returning the next day during snows rescuers shocked the mountain to release unstable snow and safely removed the body Clement was originally buried under three feet of snow Though not officially determined Howard said it appeared Clement may have died from severe head trauma The problem was they were in a ski area but they were faced with backcountry conditions They are lulled into a false sense but there s no control work done and this is the tragic outcome Howard said Howard said he has heard there were upwards of people in the area that day Clement and his friends were just in the wrong area on the wrong day and at the wrong time he said Howard said the five friends had hiked the ridgeline from Alta ski area onto Mt Baldy Not yet open for the season the upper mountain Howard said is a popular pre season destination for adventurous skiers and snowboarders But without any controls yet done on the mountain avalanche danger was extremely high and the fact that the area was closed is well posted They had to hike quite a bit to get up there Howard said but it s not atypical It s a hard way to learn but if we can prevent it from happening again then there s a small amount of good that comes from it Howard said it is imperative people learn about snow conditions and snow safety as well as carry emergency equipment Contributing Factors Weather This is the most important factor in determining whether avalanches are likely and the evolution of the snowpack is entirely dependent on this Many weather v ariables affect avalanche release and information can often be gained before setting out A sudden temperature rise may indicate a hazard as the nearer the snow gets to zero degrees celsius the more dangerous it is Remember of all avalanches occur during a snowstorm Snowpacks When visibility is adequate snowpack observation can begin from the roadside Evidence of recent avalanche activity main snow accumulation zones fresh loading by new snow and drifting can often be noted from below Observations can continue on the approach noting such details as depth of foot penetration cornice build up ease of release of small slabs and the effect which localised wind patterns may have had on slab formation Any suspect slopes which must be negotiated bearing in mind that the safest course is to avoid them may be tested by digging a snowpit Pits should not initially be dug on the main suspect slope but on small safe slopes of similar orientation The following features should be looked for Adjacent layers of different hardness difference of more than on scale of Very soft layers fist penetrates easily Water drops squeezed out of a snowball made from any layer Layers of ice Layers of graupel rounded heavily rimed pellets these act like a layer of ball bearings in the snowpack Feathery or faceted crystals Layers of loose uncohesive grains Air space Any of the above may be the source of a dangerous weakness in the snowpack Travel in Hazard Areas If it is essential to proceed the following should be borne in mind Solo travellers in avalanche terrain run particularly grave hazards Skiers are in greater danger than walkers the lateral cutting action of skis readily releases unstable snow All off piste skiers should use avalanche transceivers and have them SWITCHED ON before leaving base They should carry collapsible probes and shovels Climbers and walkers should consider the use of these items Direct descent or ascent is safer than traversing Go one at a time the others should closely observe the progress of the person on the suspect slope Close up clothing wrap scarf or other item round mouth and nose OF AVALANCHES INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS ARE TRIGGERED BY THEIR VICTIMS Safe Travel Practices middot Follow terrain features that are least likely to avalanche Use ridges and areas where the snow has been blown off to ascend or descend middot Avoid traversing under avalanche slopes If natural avalanches are likely high or extreme hazard or any time there are whomping sounds in the snowpack middot Traverse slopes as high as possible Whenever crossing a potential avalanche slope cross as high as possible so as to have as little snow to bury you as possible Watch out for a falling hazard middot When traversing slopes travel one at a time Two reasons for this one is to avoid having more than one person caught in an avalanche the other is to minimize the load on the slope middot Avoid climbing under another person Avalanches can be triggered by the other party often with little consequence to them and burying you middot Travel one at a time from safe zone to safe zone when ascending or descending gullies Look for alcoves or walls that will protect you should your partner kick off a small avalanche middot Use belaying techniques when climbing gullies that have avalanche hazard We are often told not to rope up in avalanche terrain but when rock or ice protection is available that will not slide with the slope the rope can keep you from being carried away by the avalanche This can protect you from small localized avalanches middot Watch for terrain traps Make sure that should you be involved in an avalanche the debris will not be trapped and cause a small slide to have a deep debris pile middot Watch for the falling hazard even when crossing the most benign looking slopes Even the smallest of avalanches can be deadly when mixed with a cliff band This can be important between ice bulges or on ridges middot Always wear an avalanche transceiver and carry a shovel and probe A search dog locates a buried victim Once a victim is completely buried there is only a in chance of survival ',026

took this report at face value and exploited it saying that Mauduit was perhaps not skilled enough to climb at altitude However many mountaineers quickly came to her defense In a letter to the editor of the French magazine Montagne climber Frederique Delrieu wrote Chantal lost her life by following her passion for the high altitude She did not make a mistake Delrieu added that jealousy over her accomplishments might have fueled the controversy Even more controversial was Hargreaves death along with six others in a tragic storm on K in The popular media targeted her for being a professional climber and a mother Dozens of articles lambasted her for leaving her two children at home in order to pursue a professional high altitude climbing career highlighting the double standard that still exists in the mountaineering community Mothers who pursue big climbs are assumed to be more selfish than fathers who do the same British climber authors Ed Douglas and David Rose in their biography of Hargreaves Regions of the Heart wrote that mountaineers regardless of gender have agreed that to succeed at high altitude mountaineering you had to take risks They had all done so and survived to criticize Alison for doing the same would have been hypocrisy And while the media backlash against Hargreaves didn t diminish the number of women who climb neither did it have a long term effect on the latent sexism in the general mountaineering community Says cutting edge alpinist Kitty Calhoun a mother who has attempted the Karakoram s Latok I and III I think a double standard still exists It still seems more acceptable for a dad to be a climber New Directions The death of Hargreaves also came at the time of a significant shift in focus for female alpinists visting the Karakoram Successful expeditions to the region no longer focussed on large siege style ascents Instead small groups with five or fewer members climbed quickly and with less equipment Boskoff who summitted Broad Peak in and Gasherbrum II in chooses this style of climbing I prefer to acclimatize on another mountain and then climb an er in one push Boskoff explains It s simple safer and I enjoy it I m not climbing the same route again and again to acclimatize In the summer of she attempted an alpine style ascent of K with Charlie Fowler but failed due to high winds and uncertain weather Calhoun prefers to climb in a party of just two but sometimes goes with two parties of two With this minimalist approach she has attempted the North Ridge of foot Latok I in and the West Face of foot Latok III in Along with Julie Brugger Andy DeKlerk and Colin Grissom she made it approximately one third of the way up Latok I before the weather turned sour On Latok III Calhoun her now husband Jay Smith Steve Quinlan and Ken Sauls attempted a highly technical new big wall route They were forced to abandon their attempt at over feet after running out of food Abby Watkins another top female ice rock and big wall climber and an Association of Canadian Mountain Guides certified guide says she hasn t experienced much sexism within the climbing community nor does she see much difference between the abilities of women and men Like many Gen X women Watkins an Australian expatriate living in Canada says her parents never really put gender limits on me They encouraged me at whatever I was good at or what I desired to do She also says that she has organized trips with women not because they were women but because they were my climbing partners In Watkins along with New Zealander Nicola Woolford and Australian Vera Wong established Excess Baggage VI A on foot Changi Tower in the Nangma Valley of the Karakoram s Hushe region The route took seven days and ran the gamut from mixed to free to big wall aid Accomplished British rock climber Kath Pyke agrees with Watkins and said she has gone on expeditions with women simply because she has many women partners I just know these people on a different level because I ve spent more time with them says Pyke who along with fellow Brits Glenda Huxter and Louise Thomas climbed foot Beatrice Tower on the north side of the Charakusa Valley also in the Hushe region in The threesome spent nine days linking cracks and corners with difficult traverses and blank faces The route a solidly graded A is one of only a few big walls in the Karakoram to be completed

'SATURDAY SPECIAL How a carefully planned adventure to the B C backcountry became a tragedy that swept seven teens to their deaths workopolis com Print SATURDAY SPECIAL How a carefully planned adventure to the B C backcountry became a tragedy that swept seven teens to their deaths ROD MICKLEBURGH JILL MAHONEY PATRICK BRETHOUR AND DAWN WALTON Saturday February It s a soft grey morning The ground is blanketed by eight centimetres of fresh snow The temperature hovers around zero The past hours have been avalanche free and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountry skiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass in eastern British Columbia They are not alone The mountain guides spot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popular Balu Pass Husband and wife pause to say hello It s a beautiful day out here isn t it says Abby Yes someone responds They leave the teenagers and three adults behind climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treed area Abby looks back at the people below and a gangly teen all arms and legs catches her eye Aren t kids funny Look at that kid she tells Rich At that very moment just before noon on Saturday something gives way on the rugged north face of Cheops Mountain Abby and Rich hear a thunderous roar They watch in horror as a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley picking up speed and debris The school group is directly in its path Rich screams Avalanche Avalanche Avalanche The skiers look up Ben Albert is frantically trying to cram his day pack into a big black backpack already bulging with clothes equipment and enough food for a breakfast and stir fry dinner for himself and three other hungry year olds He finally wedges it in and staggers out the door It s early Friday morning His mother Carol Neale watches uneasily as he and her husband Gerald pull out onto the road and head to the Canadian Tire parking lot on the western edge of Calgary There Ben will rendezvous with other Grade students from the elite Strathcona Tweedsmuir private school for a long weekend of backcountry telemark skiing a difficult activity that combines cross country and downhill The trip is the culmination of two months of intense training and the most arduous yet of the school s celebrated year long outdoor education program Despite the early hour the excitement among the boys and three girls is infectious Michael Shaw is so keyed up he talked the night away with his younger sister Kathryn She tried to get him to go to bed but he just kept talking They are close these healthy strong accomplished year olds Many have grown up together Michael and his best pal Taylor Carcasole are there in one of two vans that will take everyone to Rogers Pass The two are inseparable Teachers know them as mischief Taylor is the mis and Michael the chief Ben Albert sees Scott Broshko and Jeff Trickett They are three parts of a group of four talented teens known as the Fearsome Foursome Scott has been talking about the expedition almost nonstop since training began Outdoor trips are his passion For his birthday he asked for a sleeping bag The night before Daniel Arato bombarded his older brother Thomas with excited questions about what to take His father had left a day earlier for his own ski trip The two exchanged kisses and hugs Mr Arato told his son to keep his head in the game and do what he s told As the two parted Daniel told his dad I love you The leader of the expedition is teacher Andrew Nicholson a skilled and experienced skier well trained in avalanche awareness He is so demanding in checking snow conditions that previous groups have dubbed him Nazi Nick Parents have signed waivers protecting the school in the event of deaths or injuries but Carol Neale is worried She can t stop thinking about an avalanche less than two weeks before that killed seven experienced backcountry skiers just kilometres away from where Ben and his classmates are headed Scott Broshko s mother Donna knows about that avalanche too But she thinks What is the likelihood Just what is the likelihood of that She gives him a quick hug He ll be back on Monday It s a four hour journey to Glacier National Park The winding kilometre drive along the Trans Canada Highway west from Calgary offers some of the most stunning views in the country replete with neck craning mountain walls and stomach churning sheer drops to valleys below Along the way are warning signs for fallen rocks and avalanche debris Runaway lanes for truckers who lose their brakes on the steep inclines are common Even more ominous are five long avalanche tunnels protecting the highway from the walls of snow that regularly cut loose from the steep upper slopes surrounding Rogers Pass With an annual average snowfall of up to metres the area has one of the deadliest concentrations of avalanches in the world enough to keep an on site military unit stationed there equipped with explosives and howitzers to bring down threatening avalanches before they become dangerous The vans arrive at the park about noon and the STS expedition wastes no time heading for its weekend headquarters the A O Wheeler Hut an easy two kilometre trek from the highway The A frame log building complete with two wood stoves and propane systems for cooking and light is nestled in a cedar forest The cabin sleeps in three rooms The teenagers stow their large packs and after exacting tests of snow conditions by Mr Nicholson they start to ski exhilarated by liberation from school on a Friday afternoon and giddy with the fresh mountain air That evening exhausted from their wonderful afternoon the students are divided into groups Each prepares its own dinner Marissa Staddon and her group pig out on chocolate fondue Scott Broshko s dines on quesadillas much to the envy of another group grumpily making do with Hamburger Helper Through the night snoring from Scott and his pal Jeff Trickett keeps some of the boys in the same room from sleeping By the time they wake Saturday morning Parks Canada has already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountry skiers In tree line and alpine areas the avalanche risk has been assessed as considerable the mid range of the five possible ratings Below the tree line the risk is assessed as moderate with natural avalanches unlikely And the STS group intends to stay below the tree line throughout its telemark expedition to Balu Pass But the bulletin also refers to weak snow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failed to stabilize There were similar references for the same mountain range in avalanche bulletins last month just before the deadly slide that claimed seven lives near Revelstoke B C The group makes its way to the Rogers Pass information building a macaroni shaped structure with a sod and timber roof to pore over the latest information Mr Nicholson goes inside He asks about conditions in several areas before heading back to the students and two other adults a fellow teacher and a chaperone The group decides it is safe to ski that day By a m they are on the trailhead to the pass five kilometres away described by backcountry enthusiasts as an easy but beautiful trail They ski through forest along a rocky creek over a snow covered bridge and into the Connaught Creek valley Surrounded by mountains and deep powder snow the scenery is breathtaking Reminders of past avalanches are everywhere Relentless slides tearing down either side of the valley over the years have littered the area with rocks and stumps Foliage is sparse on the valley floor The school group successfully crosses four avalanche prone paths on the north side of the valley and three on the south side They note that the debris from one avalanche path across the valley is no more than a week old They are halfway to their destination The guide s frantic warning comes too late The avalanche hits them head on In a matter of seconds all skiers are swept away in a huge terrifying tangle of snow rocks and trees The swiftness and power of the avalanche sounds like a freight train moving at high speeds Abby thinks A huge roar The power of that much snow moving at the acceleration of gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way Nobody could have got out of the way Nobody The river rush of snow engulfs the skiers then separates them A section of the slide breaks away and keeps going carrying a number of victims hundreds of metres down the valley Disoriented and tumbling head over foot with little chance to swim to the surface this unlucky group ends up as much as metres beneath the concrete hard snow Up in the trees Abby and Rich are dusted by a thick cloud of powder A terrible silence falls over the valley Though their hearts are thumping they shut down their emotions On goes the search and rescue switch one they have trained for years to put into practice They race down to the first group of buried skiers The only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legs poking through the snow The others in the toe of the slide at the bottom of the valley are buried much deeper Alone at the scene the husband and wife team is faced with heartbreaking decisions Who to save first Not everybody would make it they reason But those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival Rich runs for the first hand he sees and begins digging It s Andrew Nicholson He finds Mr Nicholson s shovel so the group leader can dig himself out and moves on Mr Nicholson has a satellite phone and calls for help But for the next minutes except for the victims Rich and Abby are there by themselves working to free as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow The guides transceivers work perfectly honing in with beeps and flashing lights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons like shouts from the grave The couple follows the rules of avalanche rescue like clockwork Only dig to a victim to make sure he or she is breathing Clear snow from the victim s face No CPR before moving on to the next victim There are too many Let survivors dig themselves out Once free the numb and distraught living do their best to help Taylor Carcasole is frantic His best friend Michael Shaw is missing Where s Michael Where s Michael The victims are scattered beneath the snow Rich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible The first five people they pull out survive Those survivors go on to rescue others Everyone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead The grim lottery of who shall live and who shall die is over Seven students make it Seven do not An hour after the avalanche seven helicopters three dogs and more than individuals are on site By p m the final victim has been dug out One survivor with a broken ankle is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital The remaining survivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the park warden s station The bodies go too They are laid out on mats in a makeshift morgue in the same building Chuck Purse Revelstoke s part time coroner is investigating his second seven death avalanche within two weeks He examines each body in turn None show signs of major injury They were simply swept away and buried dying from asphyxiation The bodies are wrapped in blankets put in body bags and taken to the local Brandon Bowers Funeral Chapel Co owner Gary Sulz sends ordinary vans to collect the bodies because he thinks the sight of a fleet of hearses will upset the survivors Back in Calgary news of the tragedy begins rippling through the close knit community of parents by late afternoon Donna and Dave Broshko are just leaving for evening mass when Strathcona Tweedsmuir head Tony Macoun calls to tell them there s been an accident He says there are fatalities He doesn t say who has died Mrs Broshko immediately phones Ben Albert s mother Carol Neale Ben and Scott have been classmates since elementary school Carol have you heard There s been an accident What are you talking about No she screams I told him I didn t want him to go I didn t want him to go At the Arato home Peter skiing that weekend at Big White in Kelowna B C is talking to his wife when her cellphone rings A friend has heard news reports of a tragedy where their son Daniel was skiing Mr Arato soon learns from the radio that seven are dead from a school near Okotoks where his boy s school is He thinks the odds will not be in his favour The parents are told to go to the school Judith Arato makes the kilometre drive alone She calls Peter in hysterics Daniel is dead Mr Arato s friends charter a plane and send him home Carol Neale s worst fears are confirmed the moment she arrives at Strathcona Tweedsmuir As she steps inside the foyer another mother stops her I ve heard from my son she tells Ms Neale relief written all over her face I haven t heard from my son replies Ms Neale Minutes later Tony Macoun tells her why Ben is dead Mrs Broshko meanwhile is panic stricken a horrible sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach She can t stand not knowing She phones the RCMP in Revelstoke No luck She phones Glacier Park Lodge begging a clerk to go across the highway where the survivors are to see if her Scotty is alive Oh please please please go across the road for me I will be forever in your debt Tell me that my son is there The woman agrees She phones back No one will tell her anything Finally the anguished couple head for the school They are ushered in to see Mr Macoun It s such a tragedy he begins I don t want to hear about the tragedy Just tell me about Scott Mrs Broshko says Mr Macoun says I m very sorry Scott s gone That night Donna Broshko sleeps with a picture of Scott and her taken just before he went to the school s formal Christmas dance He is wearing his dad s suit and tie His father wore the same suit and tie at Scott s funeral on Thursday Skiers are soon back on the same Connaught Creek trail where last week s avalanche claimed its bright young victims They ask offhandedly about the morgue worried that the jagged debris may be tricky to cross Not far from the trailhead lies a wreath with two ski poles stuck upright in the snow Names of the dead year olds Jeff Trickett Scott Broshko Daniel Arato Ben Albert Marissa Staddon Michael Shaw and Alex Pattillo are listed on the wreath with the epigraph Your Youth Will Be Eternal Farther along the path one glimpses a more sombre memorial the deadly toe of the avalanche At the bottom of the valley are three pits They are several metres deep a metre across and not far apart Three burial holes left behind and no one has filled them in Timetable of tragedy On Saturday Feb Grade students from Strathcona Tweedsmuir School south of Calgary set out on a backcountry ski trip up the Balu Pass in Glacier National Park B C At around a m they were caught in an avalanche that killed seven of them Here is the sequence of events on that day Before departing the leaders checked with the National Park staff for current avalanche conditions They were advised that the threat of avalanches was moderate below the tree line and considerable above it Students were equipped with personal avalanche beacons probes and shovels At a m students left A O Wheeler Hut by van and headed to Rogers Pass Information Centre where they conducted at least one test for avalanche risk a m Commencement of trip up the Balu Pass trail Following standard procedure the one teacher led and the other adult leaders followed at the rear of the skiers who were metres from each other a m About halfway up the valley an avalanche slid off the ridge of Cheops Mountain burying the group Two skiers about metres ahead helped rescue the teacher in the lead who contacted wardens by satellite phone p m Six students were reported alive p m Wardens arrive p m All students were accounted for including the seven who lost their lives p m One of the students was tobogganed back to the motel with a broken ankle Meanwhile helicopters joined the rescue and airlifted students to the motel parking lot from where they were transported to a private home in Revelstoke How the avalanche happened A small slide began high up on the ridge of Cheops Mountain above the south side of Connaught Creek Valley This set off a huge second slide that crashed into the valley bottom with such force that it rode high up the opposite wall as it was redirected eastward down the valley burying the group of skiers copy The Globe and Mail Republished with

Summary Skiers caught buried killed MEDIA REPORTS AN OFFICIAL REPORT FROM CAA WILL BE POSTED WHEN AVAILABLE PLEASE VISIT http sportsillustrated cnn com features siadventure avalanche A Deadly Avalanche In an instant a wilderness ski trip became a nightmare as British Columbia s second fatal avalanche in days claimed seven young lives By George Dohrmann The monstrous slide estimated at more than yards wide hit with enough force to flatten acres of forest Kip Wiley They were marching up the valley in pairs their eyes alternating between the two feet of fresh powder under their skis and their destination the top of the Balu Pass Trail a ribbon of snow yards wide in British Columbia s Glacier National Park The valley is named after the creek that parts it the Connaught but residents call the primary ski route through this remote part of western Canada simply Balu One of North America s most popular backcountry recreation areas the Connaught Valley is moderately difficult to ski and was well known to the high school students moving up its north side on Feb They were children of privilege th graders at the prestigious Strathcona Tweedsmuir School STS outside Calgary Alberta A four day trip to the Rogers Pass area of Glacier National Park which includes Balu had been a tradition at STS for more than years And for this year s group students two teacher guides and another adult Day Two held great promise The temperature was approaching when they left the Rogers Pass information center shortly after a m and although clouds hid the ridge tops windows of blue sky gave the air a welcoming crispness Watching the group ski up the valley were Rich Marshall and his wife Abby Watkins professional guides from Golden B C They had stopped for tea in some timber at feet and as they stood sipping from thermoses they could see the students about feet below a twisting line of earth tones in their Gore Tex jackets and snug hats slowly ascending the same broken trail that Marshall and Watkins had skied At as Marshall was closing his thermos he heard a sharp crack from across the valley from the menacing north facing slope of Mount Cheops a peak considered too steep to ski Marshall saw the snowpack at approximately feet give way and begin a screaming descent toward the students and their guides Avalanche Avalanche Avalanche he yelled The students had only seconds before the monstrous slide estimated at more than yards wide and moving with enough force to flatten acres of forest hit First came a wall of snow one student later told wardens and then blackness Marshall and Watkins were dusted by the avalanche and waited for it to settle before speeding toward the group Investigators would later conclude that the couple saved at least five lives But there would be little solace in that fact While seven youngsters and three adults survived the avalanche another seven motivated and promising teenagers six boys and one girl died As funerals were held last week much of what Calgary learned about the lost students came from thumbnail sketches in the newspapers Ben Albert was a hockey and volleyball player Daniel Arato an eccentric who rode a unicycle Scott Broshko a trumpet player and four sport athlete Alex Patillo a lover of the theater Michael Shaw a computer whiz who favored sailing Jeff Trickett a witty saxophone player and Marissa Staddon a figure skater who loved climbing with her father The loss of young life leveled the community and sparked a debate over the value of outdoor programs at schools like Strathcona Tweedsmuir a debate that was played out wrenchingly even at the victims funerals What kind of character are we trying to build by this type of adventure Rambos said Arato s grandfather John Konig during the service for his grandson The next day year old Amanda Shaw Michael s older sister stepped to the podium at Christ Church and gave STS a much needed vote of confidence Nobody could have predicted it nobody could have prevented it said Amanda who went on an earlier Rogers Pass trip It s a great character building program Parks Canada has come under fire as well On Jan an avalanche on the Durrand Glacier miles from Rogers Pass had buried skiers and snowboarders killing seven Among the dead were four Americans Kathleen Kessler of Truckee Calif Dennis Yates of Los Angeles Ralph Lunsford of Littleton Colo and world ch ion snowboarder Craig Kelly of Mount Vernon Wash The death toll for these two avalanches is equal to the average number of avalanche deaths in Canada for the past five winters Says Peter Arato Daniel s father When a tragedy is called an accident it implies it was unavoidable But what happens in life is never that black and white There is no gray when it comes to how Canadians feel about their right to explore their national parks While there is no way to track the number of Canadians who venture into the wild it is clear that number is growing rapidly said Ross Cloutier a mountain guide who chairs the adventure programs department at University College of the Cariboo in Kamloops B C It is what this generation wants to do The most recent avalanche has spurred Parks Canada to review how it keeps adventurers safe but parks officials and outdoor enthusiasts scoff at taking more radical steps such as closing areas deemed hazardous You can t regulate the backcountry says Cloutier You can t lock it up The controversy swirling around the school programs won t pass easily Whether the STS students should have been on the mountain has been debated not only during eulogies but also in classrooms and at dinner tables in the Irish pubs on Calgary s bustling th Avenue and in mountain towns such as Revelstoke B C home to the coroner who has investigated all deaths in this year s two avalanches Outdoor excursions at STS and at other schools across Canada have been canceled or postponed as officials and families ponder whether learning the lessons that nature teaches is worth putting children in harm s way How this debate goes will determine if mountain adventure programs are viable said Dan Murphy principal at Banff Alberta Mountain Academy which canceled some trips after Feb We can only hope says Alf Skrastins director of outdoor programs at the University of Calgary that the people doing the criticizing understand the role nature can play in children s lives That role is defined early at Strathcona Tweedsmuir Initiation for first grade students includes a weekend during which they sleep in tents on c us which covers acres in the eastern foothills of the Rockies They learn environmental tenets such as leave it as you found it and are introduced to places on c us where they can hike ski canoe rock climb or otherwise explore High school and junior high students participate in trips of several days such as the excursion to Rogers Pass which was part of a for credit course for th graders The outdoor education program has made such a difference says Christine Kolanos a former member of the school s volunteer board who sent all four of her children to STS It teaches students the drive desire and dedication needed to succeed in life All those attributes were possessed by the students who left Calgary on the last day of January The teenagers also appear to have been well versed on the potential dangers in Glacier National Park On Friday as the group s vans rode the four hours to Rogers Pass they passed avalanche warning signs and went through five long tunnels built because constant slides had buried the highway Once in Rogers Pass the students skied for minutes from the highway to A O Wheeler Hut a three bedroom log cabin maintained by the Alpine Club of Canada That afternoon they skied near the cabin and supervised by Andrew Nicholson and Dale Roth avalanche certified teachers they dug avalanche pits did snowpack testing and performed compression tests on every slope They set out storm boards to collect the overnight snowfall and in the morning compared the s les with the snow already on the ground They then skied to the visitors center where Nicholson talked with officials about snow conditions and was given a daily bulletin that included weather conditions satellite imagery and avalanche danger ratings The report for Feb stated that below the tree line where the group planned to stay avalanche danger was Moderate Natural avalanches are unlikely Human triggers are possible However their route offered no protection if an avalanche occurred in the alpine areas above them which included the foot peak of Mount Cheops In the alpine areas the threat was deemed Considerable Natural avalanches are possible Human triggers are probable The guides conferred with the students who according to school officials wanted to ski for Balu Nicholson and Roth made the final decision to proceed They were headed up a valley in Glacier National Park one of the most unstable areas in Western Canada The Canadian army routinely fires howitzers in Rogers Pass in an attempt to trigger controlled avalanches and keep the highway and railways clear Layers of snow packed in the last few months had done little to lessen the threat of avalanches A Jan layer easily released during tests according to the daily report given to Nicholson A Dec layer suffered compression test failures Worst of all was the deep November layer Two laminated crusts of ice sandwiched a layer of unstable crystals to form a sort of snow plywood that had worried avalanche watchers all winter Every year the snowpack is questionable up there says John Seibert an experienced backcountry ski mountaineer from Alaska who survived the Jan avalanche on the Durrand Glacier but that s the risk And to learn about yourself you have to take risks Before the trip students had completed fitness tests and lessons in avalanche awareness and rescue During the ascent they followed the standard practice for traveling in avalanche zones of maintaining spacing between skiers in this case keeping to feet between pairs And about minutes into the trip the guides stopped the column and quizzed each student on avalanche safety protocol They were as prepared as they could have been says Ingrid Healy assistant head of school at STS As anyone could have been The wind was blowing less than mph at the tree line but it was stronger at the top of Mount Cheops where it had been blowing between mph and mph all week At a m something perhaps the weight of snow blown over the shoulder of the mountain became too much for the January layer and it cracked and slid down the mountain By itself it would have merely dusted the valley beneath it something the STS group could tell friends about upon their return But the weight was too much for the Dec layer to hold and the two layers combined heft easily cracked the fragile November crust sending approximately tons of snow into the valley We see an avalanche of that magnitude out of at least once a year but usually not in that pass says Eric Dafoe a public safety coordinator for Parks Canada and usually during a big storm period when no one is around The snow hit Nicholson first pushing him toward where Marshall and Watkins stood Marshall located Nicholson quickly because one of his arms was exposed After freeing him enough to allow him to begin digging himself out Marshall skied down to help Watkins When we arrived down at the debris we saw just about everybody was buried Watkins told Global TV affiliate CHAN in Vancouver We just started moving toward signs of life a ski glove and digging finding a face making sure they re breathing and then moving on Each student carried a shovel and a probe and wore an avalanche beacon which emits a beeping signal that can be received by another beacon The closer Watkins got to a buried student the louder and more frequent the beeps She and Marshall moved quickly but some of the group had tumbled more than yards down the valley Once free some of the rescued began trying to dig out their friends Nicholson who was carrying a satellite phone called the Rogers Pass warden and within minutes rescuers were on the scene The number grew quickly to including park staff mountain guides military personnel and heli ski guides Among the last group were staff members from the Selkirk Mountain Experience whose owner Ruedi Beglinger led the tragic Jan expedition on the Durrand Glacier But seven of the students had been buried too deep It would be an hour and minutes from the time the avalanche hit before the last body was lifted from its grasp They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time says Dafoe In the days following the disaster grieving parents questioned the decision to go for Balu If the chances of an avalanche were considerable just above where the students were to ski why take the risk STS head Tony Macoun insists that the risks were weighed by all This was not a case of the leaders dictating what would happen he says But are teenagers mature enough and informed enough to weigh the risks inherent in such a decision The criticism from Arato s family made the front pages of newspapers across Canada as did Amanda Shaw s defense of the STS program and of Nicholson He didn t want to take a risk for anything she said In the following days other family members showed support for the school s program and the decision to go for Balu I am at peace with the decision to proceed with the trip that day said Karl Staddon Marissa s father At the same time at least one of the victims families has reportedly talked to an attorney about filing a lawsuit Parks Canada and STS are the likely defendants but such a suit might do little more than extend the grief A change in Canadian law in November eliminated potential earnings as a reward in civil filings meaning that the pain of reliving the event would net each family only about U S Everyone looks for someone to blame whether it s for the avalanches or the space shuttle says Seibert the survivor of the Jan slide We have this belief that safety is guaranteed and that is ludicrous I hope that if something had happened to me my wife would have been happy knowing I didn t die watching CNN That same mind set is what administrators at Strathcona Tweedsmuir remain determined to cultivate in the school s students We will be investigating and likely adding procedures for risk assessment but this program is at the heart of who we are and how we educate and develop young people Healy says It won t end Issue date February PLEASE VISIT http www canada com vancouver Many more stories at the web site Rescue workers dug two hours to find buried teens Greg Middleton The Province With files by Calgary Herald Monday February REVELSTOKE The first thing Anders Blakstvedt saw was two teenage girls frantically digging with a shovel for classmates buried under snow He was the first person on the scene of the massive avalanche that engulfed skiers on a school field trip from Okotoks Alta Blakstvedt and a friend both mountain guides asked the girls how many people were buried When they didn t respond clearly Blakstvedt checked their avalanche transceiver and realized there were several more people under the snow The four spent nearly an hour digging to find just one victim a teenage boy who was under about three metres of snow We dug up one but we had signals everywhere you ve got to pick one he said Just that one body took us an hour to get to It took about minutes for rescue helicopters to arrive on the scene At its height the rescue effort included more than people and seven helicopters along with rescue dogs from nearby Banff National Park Blakstvedt said he and his friend witnessed the avalanche from a vantage point high up a mountain They saw it sweep down one slope It was so big it swept up another slope before sweeping down the valley towards the class that was skiing As I was heading to the top of the bowl up in the treeline I heard a big thunder and saw the slide he said Officials said the slide started on a ridge in Connaught Creek on the opposite side of the valley from the ski party Glacier Park wardens said the two guides had greeted the skiers moments earlier then moved on Moments later the guides looked back across the valley to see a huge dust cloud of snow cascading down the mountain with the young skiers in its path They warned the party with a shout of Avalanche but it engulfed them said Eric Dafoe a park warden who assisted in the rescue Back country guide Richard Marshall yelled Avalanche three times in the four to five seconds the huge snowslide rumbled down the north face of Mt Cheops Marshall and fellow guide Abby Watkins who had been having lunch in the trees opposite skied frantically down to find a hand sticking out of the snow Marshall and Watkins dug out that person who happened to be the trip s guide and a school staff member He had a satellite cellphone and that was used to call out for help said Dafoe The three then dug out several other members of the group Dafoe s fellow park warden Jordy Shetherd co ordinated the on site rescue The first person was dug out within five minutes said Shetherd said Within minutes all but three were pulled to the surface Within two hours all the party were accounted for Shetherd also said as victims were pulled from the snow they grabbed shovels and frantically joined in the search Meanwhile Parks Canada the RCMP and a military unit stationed in the area mounted a rescue operation Dafoe described as heroic It started out as a small slide high up on the mountain seen by the two people up in the trees and as it went down it dug deeper and picked up more snow Dafoe said From the time it let go to the time it hit was four to five seconds The people involved had very little time to do anything before they got hit by the snow He said the avalanche was powerful enough to destroy a house or a train Seven students swept to deaths on school ski trip Calgary area teens outing ends in disaster as party hit by giant wall of snow John Colebourn Stuart Hunter and Greg Middleton The Province with files from Canadian Press Sunday February REVELSTOKE The second deadly avalanche to hit this area in as many weeks has claimed the lives of seven high school students from Alberta on a back country ski excursion Dead are six boys and one girl all Grade students at Strathcona Tweedsmuir School a small private school in Okotoks about kilometres south of Calgary RCMP said students from the school out on an annual cross country ski trip were among people caught in the slide late yesterday morning in this popular ski touring area in east central B C B C Ambulance Service spokesman Bob Pierce confirmed the deaths The survivors were airlifted to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter Two people from the group were treated for minor injuries said RCMP Sgt Randy Brown When the call for help came in from a cell phone park wardens RCMP officers and local ski tour operators and guides backed up by helicopters and search dogs joined in the rescue effort Members of a Canadian Horse Artillery unit stationed in the park for avalanche control work were also on hand to assist The slide occurred in Glacier National Park about kilometres east of Revelstoke in the Rogers Pass area known as Knock Creek The victims were in an outdoor education class said Pam Doyle superintendent for Parks Canada in Revelstoke All three leaders of the group two male teachers and a male volunteer had certification and back country experience Macoun added The group had been skiing about metres apart with one supervisor in front and the other two bringing up the rear The skiers were halfway up the valley when the avalanche roared down the north slope burying nearly the entire group Several mountain guides out recreational skiing witnessed the slide and raced over to help Nothing like this has ever happened here before said John Jones longtime manager of the Glacier Park Lodge It s devastating of course A lot of the people who ski here know people involved in the last avalanche It s a double blow Last night teary eyed children at a local hotel could be heard placing frantic calls home to assure parents they were safe Parents began arriving last night Yesterday s slide to metres wide was the second major slide in the area in a month Seven people in a party of back country skiers died in a Jan avalanche on Durrand Glacier The avalanche yesterday occurred on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park just before noon Doyle said it swept the north face of the mountain in the Connaught Creek Valley section of Balu Valley about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit The area is not particularly remote and features well marked cross country ski trails No guides are needed to ski in the area It s a very very popular ski destination site said Pat Dunn media liaison officer at the national park The Saturday morning back country avalanche report listed the hazard for the park as considerable in both the treeline and alpine areas Doyle said there are no plans yet to close back country areas of the park Evan Manners operations manager of the Canadian Avalanche Centre here said yesterday s avalanche rating was about half way along the five level rating system But he added it was ideal conditions for an avalanche clear conditions just after a storm system passed through the area Statistically this is exactly the time when we see the majority of accidents in the few days following a storm Manners said Manners added that two significant slides in such a short period is not unusual Whether the circumstances surrounding the avalanche that swept down the mountainside yesterday near Rogers Pass is any different than those during the killer avalanche two weeks ago is uncertain What is clear is that an average of people die in avalanches every year in Canada mostly in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and B C The death toll and the promise of more to come as the popularity of backcountry touring grows is raising questions about what can be done to avert accidents Researchers backcountry enthusiasts and mountain guides argue the government must spend more money to research avalanches But others suggest that it is simply too difficult to predict when and where an avalanche will take place Students Die in Canadian Avalanche THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REVELSTOKE British Columbia Another avalanche in a region of eastern British Columbia killed seven skiers Saturday all of them high school students authorities said The dead were six boys and one girl all in grade at the Strathcona Tweedsmuir School a private institution about miles south of Calgary Alberta We are absolutely stricken with grief Our hearts go out to all those who are impacted said Tony Macoun head of the school There were people in the school group three adults and students in an outdoor education class on their annual cross country ski trip The leaders of the group were two male teachers and a male volunteer All three leaders had certification and backcountry experience Macoun said The survivors were airlifted to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter said Bob Pearce of the British Columbia Ambulance Service One was hospitalized and some others suffered minor injuries a Glacier Park spokesperson said Names and further details about the victims were not available until next of kin could be notified The slide occurred just before noon Saturday in the Rogers Pass area of Glacier National Park in western Canada The avalanche which ran for about a mile was capable of destroying acres of forest said Pat Dunn a Parks Canada spokeswoman Two mountain guides who had just passed the students saw the avalanche and warned them before it hit park warden Jordy Shepherd said They were the first to help dig the victims out after the slide engulfed the group Some victims were buried under about feet of snow Dunn said As many as seven helicopters helped in the rescue effort It was second major avalanche in the Revelstoke area in days A Jan avalanche in the same region killed seven people four Canadians and three Americans including snowboard pioneer Craig Kelly A memorial service for those victims was held Friday Show

following May report originally appearing in the American Alpine Club Sierra Nevada Section Newsletter July August is reprinted with the permission of Eliza Moran and the American Alpine Club T he British Mountaineering Council sponsored a first in the world a symposium dedicated to and for woman climbers The idea was to bring together women climbers of all abilities to explore issues facing them and to enjoy climbing in one of the UK s premier venues North Wales Twenty six countries responded by sending women ranging in age from to years Every aspect of this sport was represented in the diversity of women sent mountaineers ice climbers traditional rock climbers boulderers sport climbers professionals and amateurs What came out of this meeting As the group first came together it was quite apparent that we judged each other by nationalities Interaction began in English no matter the country of origin The official welcomes and written agenda presented by our hosts did not really hint at what would transpire during the week I don t think that most of the invited guests really knew just what we were going to do either but like all grand adventures it begins with the first step Over meals out climbing in lectures and while shopping for climbing equipment that was generously offered at discount rates by local manufacturers and stores we came to discover who we were National labels fell by the wayside as we found no stereotypes in looks or styles No elitism or competition manifested itself as a form of segregation during our climbing days Educational levels ranked highly with a strong representation in the sciences and medicine Climbing was it a hobby a sport a job a form of competition or a way of life This theme soon emerged as new personalities came to the front daily expressing viewpoints that were encouraged by our British women climber hosts Why do we stay in climbing Here the answers became as varied and intriguing as one might expect Who encouraged you Who supports you Why were you sent to represent your Federation at this symposium Was it a man who selected you What do you think that you will take back with you to your Federation from this symposium Again another theme became apparent as we all saw the similarities of our predicaments as woman athletes trying to validate our desire to climb One of the BMC s guest speakers on media night lecture in addition to our AAC President Alison Osius was author and pathologist Dr Rosemary Cohen She presented a small chronology of books and articles written about women climbers Of note was an article written in entitled Thwarted Maiden Lady This defined the woman climber as a spinster who could not find or get a man to marry her Universal laughter filled the room as this was translated not an easy task to translate thwarted into languages However in this laughter was a recognition amongst us of the the shadow question that still exists today for all women You must be climbing because your real life as a woman is not complete i e no man to marry Something must be missing that is causing you to do this otherwise a happy woman would not be climbing Why do you want to take that risk and if you do now that you are having children you wouldn t do that anymore would you Every woman in the room had faced some format of this question sometime in her life When we heard of the lonely efforts of the woman climbers in Iran India Nepal and Pakistan we knew that we were not so far removed from this ourselves Francoise Aubert UIAGM French Guide that makes her living guiding revealed to us that her new ice route topping out on Point Helen was not recognized by her French Climbing Federation As of yet this ice climb has not been repeated In solidarity we realized we are not so far removed from the stigma of the Thwarted Maiden Lady Many wonderful exchanges continued that were as novel as the speakers Backgrounds as exotic as the countries represented and adventures came to the front as we discovered who we were oceanographers physicists physicians teachers biologists flight attendants North Sea oil riggers physical therapists students grandmothers tour operators public relations directors We were problem solvers We too came to ask ourselves the question Why do you climb As to the diversity of answers supplied I will leave that to you the reader to surmise I came away from this meeting fatigued I did not want to miss out on anything This meeting enabled me as an AAC Director to ask for a statement of support for our club s position with the Friends of Valley in our lawsuit against the National Park Service After a day of intense discussion with all delegates I was proud to see this group give the AAC a unanimous vote of support You can see this statement on The Friends of Yosemite Valley web site What is the image of the woman climber She is anything and everything she is always the same and she is never the same She can make a difference and will if given the chance Whatever you may think I believe it is safe to say we don t see ourselves as Thwarted Fair Maidens We see ourselves as elusive in identification as the adventures we seek How else could names such as The Wall of the Early Morning Light or Dreams of White Horses come to be without this imagination and desire for the unknown But then again that is what being a woman is all about an elusive evolving image that we choose to explore as we get to know ourselves Perhaps that is what life can be perhaps that is why mountaineering is a way of life for those who are bold and dare The

event of the season Three filmmakers represent this great period of change Scott Dittrich was the last of the full time surf moviemakers Fluid Drive his first effort was a smash hit in From to he gathered footage from a network of cameramen around the world and put together six full length surf movies In his year career Jack McCoy has created the greatest body of work ever by a surf filmmaker

'Nose in a Day Page History and Records The Nose History and Records Note This stuff was compiled by John Black and its accuracy is questionable Please if you have any corrections or additions email me and let me know History and Records The Nose was first climbed by Warren Harding and partners in days finishing on November It was repeated in by Royal Robbins Joe Fitschen Chuck Pratt and Tom Frost in a very respectable days In Bauman solos the Nose for the first time El Cap had already been soloed by Robbins the year before he did the Muir Wall In Jim Bridwell John Long and Billy Westbay do the Nose in a Day NiaD for the first time Long led mostly free to the top of Boot Flake Westbay did the mixed middle section to C and Bridwell nailed to the summit Their time was about hours In ten years after the Bridwell Long Westbay ascent the NiaD had seen only about repeats In Steve Shipoopi Schneider solos the Nose in In Merry Braun becomes the first woman to climb the NiaD she climbed with her husband Werner Braun The existing NiaD record is which is first lowered to by Florine and Schneider and then shattered by Peter Croft and Dave Schultz with their ascent They climb most of the route in the dark to avoid passing parties Also Don Snyder does the NiaD three times in one season In Hans Florine and Andy Puhvel set the mark at edging out a slightly improved Croft Schultz time of over last year s record Croft and Schultz replied with another record shattering ascent this time in daylight of In Croft teams up with Hans Florine to set the current record The first all female ascent of the NiaD is done in just under hours by Sue McDevitt and Nancy Feagin on the same day Croft later soloed the Steck Salathe in the same day as a warm down In Florine sets the record for soloing the NiaD an amazing As a warm up Lynn Hill climbs the Nose with Florine in about hours the female record Hill later frees the Nose as well In Hill does the NiaD the hard way she freeclimbed every pitch In basically nothing happened In Abby Watkins and Vera Wong set the current all women s Nose record at In Galen Rowell becomes the oldest man to climb the NiaD the year old acclaimed photographer sent the route in hours swinging leads with partner Conrad Anker In the NiaD went mainstream in the movie Jerry Maguire when Kelly Preston playing Tom Cruise s fiance utterred those oh so learned words I ve climbed the hour Nose route to the top of El Capitan in hours and minutes I can make THIS work What the In Hans Florine and Nancy Feagin climb the Nose and Reg Route on Half Dome in Feagin becomes the first woman to repeat this classic Bachar Croft enchainment The pair climbed the Nose in missing the female record held by Hill and climbed Half Dome in In Hans Florine does the NiaD for the th time Also Herson and Harrell become the only other pair to link the Salathe and the Nose in a push hrs Dean Potter lowers the NiaD solo record to In Hans Florine and Tommy Caldwell showed that the NiaD record of was not out of reach they clocked the second fastest time ever at A couple of weeks later Dean Potter and Timmy O Neill set the new mark at Two weeks later Hans Florine answered back with partner Jim Herson to lower the record by a little more than minutes clocking in at Not to be discouraged Potter and O Neill went back up five days later and set the current record I m sure Florine would have answered back had Winter not arrived soon thereafter In Hans Florine and Yuji Hirayama sliced another minutes off the current record to set the new current mark My prediction is that this record will stand for a long time Timmy O Neill thinks it could go much faster if a few cardio monsters did a lap but the combination of world class aerobic fitness and the ability to climb with big run outs is something we re not likely to see in the near future Enchainments The NiaD is often done by super climbers in conjunction with other routes The first and most famous of these is the John Bachar and Peter Croft climb of the Nose followed by the Reg Route on Half Dome in the same day They put up a time of hours for the Nose and then amazingly passed parties climbed through the rain and set the Half Dome record in just over hours which lasted until In Dean Potter soloed the Nose and Half Dome in the same day Two days later Hans Florine did this as well El Cap was first climbed twice in the same day in when Croft and Schultz climbed the Nose and the Salathe in a total time of hours El Cap was first climbed three times in one day in by Florine and Schneider the pair climbed the Nose the West Face and Lurking Fear using fixed ropes for descent and pre caching water In Dean Potter soloed the Nose then Half Dome in the same day A few days later Hans Florine repeated this feat in doing the routes in the reverse order starting the watch at the base of Half Dome and stopping at the top of El Cap Perhaps one of the most amazing enchainments is Potter and O Neill s link up of Half Dome s Regular Route the South Face of Watkins and the Nose in under hours The pair started Half Dome at am Watkins at pm and the Nose around midnight hard core

you in favour of such a trend Yes No Not sure Results Related story Brave rescuer was on autopilot By MIKE D AMOUR CALGARY SUN GOLDEN B C More than seven people would have certainly died in a weekend avalanche if not for her rescue efforts but Abby Watkins says she s no hero The victims were in the worst possible situation at the worst time and we were in the best position to stage a rescue the year old assistant alpine guide said yesterday from her home here Anybody would have done the same thing Watkins and her husband Rich Marshall were skiing just above a group of Strathcona Tweedsmuir school students two teachers and an adult chaperone near Rogers Pass Saturday morning when the pair saw the avalanche begin Despite the couple s warning shouts all were hit by the fast moving wall of snow There was nothing they could do but brace themselves Watkins recalled It was very fast moving and when it hit the kids it carried them for or metres before it stopped As soon as the killer wave of snow came to rest Watkins and her husband skied about metres through the trees to reach the buried group All they could see was a single arm reaching through the snow They freed that person an adult chaperone with a satellite phone that was used to call park wardens for help Watkins who has training in such rescues but was never pressed to use her skills until Saturday morning and her husband turned their avalanche beacons from send to receive mode and started digging down to the rest of the group As one person was freed they too would start digging through the snow searching for their peers The teens although shaken by the twist of events that turned a pleasant field trip into an unthinkable nightmare almost immediately pitched in with little urging from Marshall and Watkins They wanted to do something Watkins said They tirelessly dug through the compacted snow while Watkins and her husband talked to the traumatized teens assuring them help was close at hand By the time the organized rescue party arrived all but two had been accounted for I was thinking a lot but I was mostly on autopilot Watkins said She credits her husband for keeping her focused Watkins said some of the survivors parents have thanked her but she has not dealt emotionally with the weekend s events We didn t sleep too well last night she said adding she may want to talk to someone later Parks

Info Hello to all our friends and sympathetic listeners It s been too long once again since we ve been in touch with you but it is with gratitude that we sit down to write you now We re grateful to all those of you who joined us on climbs trips and adventures during the last months We re also grateful for the places we ve had the privilege to go and the things we ve been able to attempt and often achieve Since we wrote you last July we ve had another great summer season of guiding in the Alps an attempt on Cho Oyu and a fairly tranquil fall and winter season mostly at home unusual for us We enjoyed an uncommonly good early season snowpack here in the Sierra timely for us since we had bought season s passes at Mammoth Mountain at fire sale prices last spring Alan Maurer and Mark found this weather on Mont Blanc Photo Info Here s the lowdown on the last few months activities July August Alps Alan Maurer of Salt Lake City was joined by Mark for an attempt on Mont Blanc in mid July A monster dump of snow made the hike up to the Go ucirc ter Hut truly a mountaineering experience in and of itself and the weather continued too poor to make a realistic attempt After returning to Chamonix in defeat they scooted up the Cosmiques Ar ecirc te as a consolation prize a cold climb on a brilliant clear day After that Susan Lowery and her husband Roy Zagieboylo hooked up with Mark for climbing in the Chamonix area They accomplished a lot in a few short days including the Petite Aiguille Verte beware Chris Kulp the gauntlet has been thrown down Pointes Lachenal the Cosmiques Ar ecirc te the SE Ridge of the Tour Ronde the Index the Midi Plan traverse and Mont Blanc du Tacul on an arctic weather day Meanwhile Joan Sutherland of Groton New York was climbing with Kathy This was a first time trip together for these two and they too accomplished a lot both in the summits department and in the realm of NYT Sunday Crossword Puzzles a fetish of Kathy s They started out in the Chamonix area a traverse of the French Italian frontier ridge to the summit of the Aiguille d Entr egrave ves was done in two separate half day installments combined with other climbs the SE ridge of the Tour Ronde the Cosmiques Ar ecirc te and Mont Blanc via the traverse of Mont Blanc du Tacul and Mont Maudit on the descent from which Joan had to shepherd a suddenly flu stricken and helpless Kathy back to her hotel bed before heading over to Zermatt where they had the great luck of good weather and conditions on the Matterhorn Joan and Kathy were thrilled to succeed on both Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn a combination requiring both great stamina and excellent luck with the weather Joan had both Susan and Roy on Mont Blanc du Tacul Photo Info Alas such luck was not to bless Jon Penn during his second attempt to climb the Matterhorn this time with Kathy Jon is ready willing and itchin to get that peak but a truly huge dump of snow put it out of reach during the time he had for it this year Jon did get in a climb of the Wellenkuppe and Obergabelhorn a big climb with great views involving plenty of variety and challenge both on rock and on icy snow slopes The route was generously smattered with ice and newly fallen snow which along with a chill stiff wind made for a tough long and satisfying climb An attempt the following day on the Zinalrothorn was foiled by the same multi day storm that thwarted the Matterhorn attempt as well Instead after an amusing drizzly slippery descent of the via ferrata in the Gorner Gorge they headed over to Monte Rosa only to be turned back by an icy flesh freezing wind Sometimes the mountains can be cruel While Kathy and Jon were freezing their butts in Zermatt Emery Dameron was met by Mark in Chamonix where they climbed the Index and Cosmiques Ar ecirc te despite a nagging knee injury of Emery s Chris Kulp the intrepid was back in the Alps with Mark in August They got in several great rock routes before a variation of the Chamonix Plague that was still circulating put Chris down for several days and foiled an attempt on the Meije in the Ecrins region near La Grave Feeling better for the Innominata route on Mont Blanc they were turned back by weather that was too good The hot sun made crossing the central couloir high on the route inadvisable Still among the great routes they explored together were the Aiguille du Peigne The Fl egrave che Rousse on the Aiguille d Argenti egrave re Mani Puliti in the Aiguilles Rouges the Tour des Crochues by the Galbert route and Tchao Godillo in the Col de la Colombi egrave re Chris Kulp on the Traverse of the Aiguille d Entr egrave ves The Aiguille verte in the background Photo Info Emery on the Aiguille de l Index Photo Info Chris Kulp on Mani Puliti a great rock route in the Aiguilles Rouges Photo Info Chris hams it up on the summit of the Aiguille d Argenti egrave re Photo Info Finally Kathy headed over to the Dolomites to join a contingent of the Latham family Andy wife Jan and sons Adam and Stephen They had fun in the sun climbing sport and multi pitch routes on fine limestone and s ling some of the airy exciting and historic via ferrata near the town of Cortina enjoying great pasta and coffee After a day of sight seeing en famille in Venice Andy and Kathy saw Jan and the boys off at the Milan airport and drove to Switzerland for a last few productive days climbing before their time ran out They had good weather and quickly climbed the Jungfrau followed by the Eiger via the Mittellegi Ridge and South Ridge descent This exciting extremely exposed ridge climb was a long committing beautiful climb on a gorgeous day Following that with one day left they drove over to Piz Bernina and climbed the beautiful mixed ridge on the Piz Palu before parting company in Milan Cho Oyu as seen from Base C The wind blows a big lenticular over the summit Photo Info Chris and Kathy on Mount Conness Photo Info A Winter at Home mostly We hadn t been home long before Chris Kulp made the drive over the hill for a quick climb of the North Ridge of Conness a great fall day This winter we have been working away on a writing project and skiing and climbing too Since January our skis have had less use than our ice climbing gear however Kim McElhinney and Hugh Driscoll came out for a weekend at Lee Vining with Kathy while Mark roped up with several other visitors Chris Kulp Frank Sainburg of Avila Beach Wanda Neste of Palm Springs and Scott Anderson of Pacific Palisades In late January Kathy headed back to Ouray Colorado for the rd annual Chicks With Picks event hosted by Kim Reynolds of San Juan Mountain Guides of Ouray This year Chicks was better attended and organized even than before The clinic was expanded to include a few more participants and several new extremely strong and professional guides joined the line up Carolyn Parker Abby Watkins Mattie Sheafor Anna Keeling and Amy Bullard joined the established group of Kitty Calhoun Angela Hawse Jen Grimes and Kathy The depth and strength of this group of instructors allows women of all levels of experience and ability from absolute beginners to experienced leaders and mixed climbers to be challenged and get a lot of climbing and learning in a short time Abby and Kathy gave well received slide shows attended by the chicks as well as by local residents and visiting climbers These events featuring auctions and a bar stocked by a local brewery cheap gear and free beer benefit a local women s shelter and every year raise more money for a great cause Kathy says she feels honored and privileged to be a part of this event which she looks forward to every February Now we re breaking in our tight little rock shoes and trying to get out rock climbing in the Owens River Gorge a couple of times per week Spring is just around the corner and we want to be in shape for it and for y all WHAT S NEXT FOR March Sunny Rock Frozen Ice At the end of March Kathy

point second ascent But subsaquent ascents the protection was put in on abseil and whilst dogging it hence it s grade of This assumption that an E grade in front of a number would some how magically give the climber an idea of the seriousness of a route is false E grades can mean any number of things yes it can denote big fall or ground fall potential but also how stenuous the route may be or how pumpy and fiddly the gear is to place Ex le Using another HB route Welcome to Barbados Ewbank which still awaits a second ascent with protection in place let alone putting all runners in on lead E grades it would be E c or as you suggest E Get the picture or do I have to spell it out further If you get to the bottom of a climb and look up and have no idea of what you are about to get into then you have no business being there in the first place The thing is that grades in the gym and grades in the real world do not coralate and I think this is where the vast majority of the problem lies The person who can do the blue route at which ever gym which is graded gets out onto real rock pumps out half way up an because placing pro takes time and energy falls off and strips all his gear and goes to hospital true story There for in his mind its an unsafe route It takes relatively little time and energy to safely climb the blue route in the gym especially when your out to impress but years to climb to the same technical ability on Rock Climbs there is no such thing as trad climbing Rock Climbs can have bolts As for bolting D Minor I am assuming your post hex was just to see what sort of reaction you could stir up I could go on but cant be stuffed But I would however get my appathetic arse of the couch and go and chop them Other thoughts Nobody is forcing you up there Why not just top rope it if all your interested in is the moves that would require setting up an anchor which may involve runner placement P S If the latest hard man or woman cranking the desperates can only lead on natural gear does this still make them good climbers another true story Joe PM If the latest hard man or woman cranking the desperates can only lead on natural gear does this still make them good climbers another true story A good climber is whatever you reckon is good Personally I believe you must do alpine ascents of all m peaks onsight serpentine placing only pitons on lead drink beers while soloing ozymandias direct in winter and climb punks in the gym without using the chipped hold before you are a good climber James AM This assumption that an E grade in front of a number would some how magically give the climber an idea of the seriousness of a route is false of course its not a magic fix but it would still be valuable E grades won t take all the adverture or unknown factor out of the climbing As stated the E grade should be the seriousness of the lead ascent The unknown factor might be whether the route is run out on easy ground or if the gear is fiddly but on steep ground hence a safe fall etc etc The E grade shouldn t be affected solely by how pumpy strenuous a route is but more so it should be an indication of how pumpy strenuous it is to placing the gear ie most Nowra clip n go routes would be E E perhaps another ex le Sandinista would have a higher E grade than the s at the Gallery as you have to hang round place gear the concept of a good climber is even more subjective than grading systems hex TROLL PM Joe that s not as think as you silly it is the late great Mark Moorhead was well on the way minus the beer to achieving your criteria The biggest myth in Australian climbing that the Ewbank system takes into consideration The Ewbank system takes into consideration THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TECHNICAL CRUX OF A CLIMB A m grade with bolts every metre is the same as a m grade requiring tricky route finding well spaced RP placements It is that sameness which drives the retro bolting pressure mainly from the sport faction as they try to rationalise deny their reality of Why can I send on draws and yet freak out approaching when I have to start thinking about all those other considerations stuff it just whack a few more bolts in so more ons people can enjoy the climb How does the cyber cauldron manage to smell so good Luv HEX WM PM The biggest myth in Australian climbing that the Ewbank system takes into consideration The Ewbank system takes into consideration THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TECHNICAL CRUX OF A CLIMB Bzzz Wrong Or at least badly put Are you trolling or is the cauldron smoke in your eyes Shepherd guide page a number which incorporates every variable technical difficulty sustainedness seriousness ie absence and or quality of protection For ex le Bygone is technically grade but lacks protection and so the grade is bumped up to With the addition of a fixed hanger and no change in technical difficulty shock horror waddya know Bygone is back down to in the Mentz Tempest guide Ah the Ewbank system in all its glory Never knew myths were so tangible and workable James PM the Ewbank system was originally designed to take all those things into account but I am with Hex here in practise there is far too much emphasis on the technical moves other factors are not adequately compensated for hex TROLL PM grades for a fixed hanger oh dear that IS mentzal as anything Any other convincing ex les aw what about Serpentine yeah right Standing up wind of the cauldron Luv HEX kieranl PM The Mentz Tempest guide overdoes it in places How about the first pitch of Yo Yo no added fixed gear and it gets bumped up to It is glorious climbing but probably or it s certainly easier than Muldoon First pitch of Watchtower Crack gets I usually lead that pitch with one runner no matter how badly I am climbing I would call it or Joe PM Hex Dude what makes you think i am being silly Mark Moorhead well on the way to achieving the criteria really and truly I think not how many ers alpine style punks WITH the chipped hold beers on a rainy day visionary yes god no Bring on the trad elitism dude James AM Mark Moorhead was climbing rock routes within a few grades of the upper limit of the time late s early s he went missing died on an m mountain I m yet to hear of any other Australians doing the same although some have come close grade m mountains Rupert AM Andrew Lindblade and Athol Whimp Damietta AM Rupy and Simon Parsons IN the same league but not pushing the free climbing grades quite as high John Fantini Vera Wong Abby Watkins Greg Child John Muir Andrew McCauley dalai PM Parsons has climbed up to definitely in that league Lindblade has climbed up to grade James PM of course don t know why I missed those nmonteith PM Greg Child has climbed grade routes plus numerous himalyan m and big wall routes WM PM I can t argue with Keiran that Mentz Tempest have chopped and changed grades willy nilly in both directions Necrophiliac Bostok being other ex les But thats a different issue they are taking an identical set of technical sustained seriousness factors and saying previous guide s simply added them up wrong For Bygone and its new FH the equation is now different Its the ex le chosen by Shepherd and more illustrative than your hypothetical s Hex As for whether a FH is worth grades in this instance I d say hell yeah It was a death lead without now its a lovely jaunt with The grade value given to this change has to be an average of climbers so its always going to be approximate too much for bolder climbers that must be you Hex you big hard man you not enough for Hex s more ons But E grades aren t any more exact Hex my dear do you agree with James that the problem is with the implementation of the Ewbank system If so a whole new system isn t the solution proper use of the existing system is BTW the E grade system does not apply to sport routes the poms switch to French grades on their sport crags so Sandinista and Weaveworld would still end up with non comparable grades whats to be gained Enough ranting whoever you are Hexy you sure have a lot of time on your hands just doing my best to keep up hex TROLL PM Stop ranting start chanting hex TROLL PM On hex TROLL wrote The Ewbank

ride another kms before finding a place to pull off the highway to c for the night We had surprise visitors in the morning when two emus walked into c at first oblivious to our presence but then dancing off in their strange swaying bobbing wingless gait as they became aware of us It was a busy morning as their vacated spots were filled by a herd of wild goats We were to see large numbers of feral goats and sheep in the next few days until reaching the Murchison Boundary fence that stretches for km across Western Australia providing a barrier to stop them munching on the greening vegetation that met us as we headed south Wildflowers are a major reason people travel to Western Australia in the spring The more we followed the compass south the more colourful and prolific the roadside displays of wildflowers became The isolation of Western Australia is a factor in the uniqueness and variety of the species to be found here numbering up to Approaching Kalbarri National Park the road was lined with the silvertipped branches of the smokebush and yellow flowering wattle with clusters of red banksias grevilleas kangaroo paws and patches of everlastings in carpets of brilliant pink yellow and purple It was a spectacular showcase that slowed our progress as June insisted on identifying each new species she saw At a roadside reststop I caught up to June who introduced me to a fellow wanderer Mary Ebbott Mary s daughter Abby Watkins lives in Golden and along with Rick Marshall spends much of her time in the mountains climbing and exploring We look forward to making a connection with them upon our return Kalbarri is one of those jewels on a traveller s roadmap that makes you want to hang around for a while longer Surrounded on one side by heathlands of exquisite wildflowers and on another by the deep red rock gorges of the Murchison River and yet on another side by an ocean that has carved a jagged coastline of red banded cliffs Kalbarri has managed to retain a low profile village atmosphere that provides a sheltered harbour from the storms of the world It may not have appeared so idyllic for the first settlers in the area Back in two mutinous crew members from the Dutch East India trading ship the Batavia were put ashore here giving them the distinction of being the first European settlers albeit unwillingly in this country yet to be discovered by Captain Cook Kalbari Cliffs The Batavia shortly thereafter hit a reef and sank as did numerous other early visiting ships to the region The constant pounding of the Indian Ocean surf has claimed massive chunks of red sandstone and white limestone from the towering cliffs continuously moulding the landscape into caves natural bridges and rugged coastal gorges One of the trips most memorable meals was eaten at Finlay s B B Q in Kalbarri Aussie style cooked in a tin shed and eaten outside under the stars on a sand floor sitting around a c fire The pile of seafood and salad was staggering and entertainment was provided by anyone who wanted to get up and play an instrument or sing Need a napkin grab a toilet roll and drinking water came in wine bottles You couldn t complain about the service in this restaurant there wasn t any If you didn t serve yourself you went without We thought we had taken a wrong turn out of Kalbarri and had somehow ended up in England The countryside quite suddenly became rolling green farmland in total contrast to the scenery of the past months North ton was a stopover where we visited the local school Set in rolling hills dotted with sheep and smothered in purple wildflowers it is an agricultural village with a population of and quaint sandstone block buildings Teacher Ann Williams arranged for us to give a presentation to a large group of students ranging in age from grades to They were a very attentive and well behaved group of students and it was most rewarding to visit a school that my former students had been emailing from Kimberley Following the coast road down to Perth we c ed overnight in a shanty town of lobster fisherman shacks Lobster fishing is big business which is encouraging the haphazard growth of squatter s shacks along the remote beaches Government bulldozers were busy at work on a not very popular clean up c aign North ton Norh ton School Pinnacles Desert The southern beaches have the whitest sand we had ever seen due to a high concentration of lime in the region It is also one of the richest areas for plant species in the world with the heathlands boasting more than recorded species more than all the native plants recorded for Great Britain It is difficult to fathom since the sandy soils are extremely low in nutrients and don t hold moisture well but the plant life has adapted to this adversity and evolved in amazing numbers We discovered an interesting desert landscape when we visited the Pinnacles Desert near Cervantes Huge limestone pillars rise out of the surrounding desert sands resembling ancient tombstones The early Dutch explorers seeing them from offshore thought were seeing the remains of an ancient city It is time for a break and we went in search of a T V to watch the opening ceremonies of the Sydney Olympic Games It certainly was a spectacular opening and the first few days of competition indicate that this Olympics will be a very successful event Pinnacles Questions for students to ponder On a map locate the geographical position that we crossed for the second time at degrees minutes South and degrees minutes East How soon before Captain Cook s discovery of Australia did the earliest European visitors the two mutinous crew members from the Batavia land on the west coast What is the only other city in the southern hemisphere to host an Olympic Games In what year How many sports will be featured in Olympic competition in Sydney How many countries are competing in this Olympic games One of the sports that Australian students play is

'Bouldering and Rock Climbing at Webcrag Skiers Rally Against Recent Yellowstone Decision More than Protest Court Ruling Overturning Parks Snowmobile Ban West Yellowstone Montana More than skiers from around the nation gathered in Yellowstone National Park to speak out against Tuesday s federal court ruling that again allows snowmobile use in the park We must preserve this park now before it s too late said Haidee Wilson from North Carolina This park is a national possibly even an international gem and we must do what we can to ensure that future generations can visit Yellowstone in its original state The rally hosted by Winter Wildlands Alliance WWA took place just inside the park s West Gate which is now the entryway for up to snowmobiles per day On Tuesday U S District Judge Clarence Brimmer issued a temporary restraining order that suppresses a pending ban on snowmobiling in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks Brimmer ruled that without the order companies that rely on snowmobiling in the parks would suffer irreparable harm because of lost business I m upset that Brimmer s decision completely ignores us skiers and snowshoers said Mack Bray from Jackson Hole Wyoming We stay in hotels eat in restaurants and have money that is as green as anyone else s But we can t recreate here in the midst of pollution and engine noise Without a ban there s just no point in us coming here A Dec ruling by U S District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan reinstated a Clinton era plan to phase out snowmobile use in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks The effect of the court s ruling would have been to reduce snowmobile use in the parks this year by half and eliminate snowmobile use next year Many residents of the Park s gateway community of West Yellowstone expressed concerns that the Dec ruling would reduce winter tourism dollars WWA s event was to be an attempt at re introducing human powered winter recreationists to the park Many skiers and snowshoers avoided Yellowstone in the winter because it was previously considered to be a haven of motorized recreation Winter Wildlands expects the long term effect of a snowmobile ban in the parks to actually be an increase in tourism dollars as more user groups flock to a safer quieter more pristine Yellowstone while snowmobilers continue to utilize the more than miles of snowmobile trails just outside the Park WWA officials estimated that the attendees of their celebration pumped more than into local economies Skiers and snowshoers have told us they re ready to return to places like West Yellowstone and we re confident they ll play a key role in expanding the community s tourism base once snowmobile use is banned from our parks said WWA Executive Director Sally Grimes With a complete phase out of snowmobiles still scheduled for next winter Grimes said it is critical that the Park Service Congress local businesses and government leaders and recreation organizations like WWA work together to find new ways to draw more winter visitors to West Yellowstone and other gateway communities Winter Wildlands is calling for a modernization of the Yellowstone snowcoach fleet and better education of the public on the diverse winter recreation opportunities in and around Yellowstone Based in Boise Idaho Winter Wildlands represents more than million skiers snowshoers snowboarders and other non motorized snowsports enthusiasts It is the lone recreation group among the six plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit over the National Park Service s winter use plan for Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks About Winter Wildlands Alliance Founded in Winter Wildlands Alliance promotes and preserves winter wildlands and a quality human powered snowsports experience on public lands By working with grassroots groups across the country on local issues and as the national public policy and land management regulation watchdog for skiers and snowshoers throughout the country Winter Wildlands Alliance ensures that future generations will be able to enjoy a safe quiet and pristine winter recreation experience For more information contact Ken Miller Public Policy Manager at Cell or visit www winterwildlands org Skiers Say Court Setback Underscores Need for Yellowstone Rally Expected in Park for Valentine acirc euro s Day Show of Support for Yellowstone WEST YELLOWSTONE MT Fresh from a U S District Court ruling that suddenly and dramatically increased the number of snowmobiles allowed in Yellowstone National Park the rest of this winter skiers and other winter recreationists are coming to Yellowstone this weekend to rally in support of the park and re assert their demand to eliminate the machines from the park The ruling in Wyoming is a huge disappointment especially since four federal judges in Washington D C soundly rejected the governments push to keep snowmobiles in Yellowstone Winter Wildlands Alliance Executive Director Sally Grimes said But this setback only underscores the need for skiers snowshoers and other non motorized snowsports enthusiasts from around the nation to rally once again in Yellowstone in support of the park and all it represents The fight for a clean healthy and quiet Yellowstone is far from over and we are more energized than ever As it did last Presidents Day weekend Winter Wildlands Alliance is inviting members and supporters from across the United States to gather in Yellowstone on Valentines Day to voice their support for the park An estimated supporters are expected to attend both a Friday night pre rally reception and the main event on Saturday morning just inside Yellowstones west entrance The rally comes just four days after U S District Court Judge Clarence Brimmer in Wyoming blocked the phase out of snowmobile use underway in Yellowstone by ruling in favor of the snowmobile industry and the state of Wyoming The snowmobile industry and the state are battling to keep snowmobiles in Yellowstone despite National Park Service studies that show the way to best protect the park is to ban the machines Winter Wildlands joined five national and regional conservation and environmental groups in fighting to restore the three year old snowmobile phase out launched by the Clinton administration but overturned by the Bush White House U S District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington agreed with the coalition in December overturning the Bush administration plan to allow more snowmobiles in Yellowstone and ordering the Park Service to begin the phase out That ruling was later upheld by an appellate panel But this week the Wyoming judge halted the phase out prompting the Park Service to immediately begin allowing vastly more machines into the park than allowed so far this winter The Park Services answer to this controversy is no answer at all Grimes said It is now allowing machines into Yellowstone up from the that were allowed before this ruling Those who have visited the park so far this winter have been amazed at how much quieter and cleaner it is this year Now we are back to business as usual Yellowstone will be louder dirtier and less healthy this weekend than it was last weekend This is Americas park and Americans have spoken overwhelmingly in favor of the snowmobile ban that the Park Service says is needed to protect Yellowstone Instead of looking for ways to get more snowmobiles into Yellowstone we should be focusing on finding the resources needed to get more visitors into the park on snowcoaches just as the Park Service suggested three years and millions of dollars worth of studies ago During the course of this weekend Winter Wildlands will be encouraging Yellowstone rally participants to redouble efforts to contact their elected officials in Washington and to step up lobbying on behalf of a snowmobile free Yellowstone Winter Wildlands has joined such groups as The Wilderness Society National Parks Conservation Association Greater Yellowstone Coalition Natural Resources Defense Council the Sierra Club and the Natural Trails and Waters Coalition in c aigning to remove snowmobiles from the two parks as recommended by the Park Service in before the Park Service reversed itself after being sued by the snowmobile industry With thousands of miles of groomed snowmobile trails surrounding Yellowstone there are le opportunities for snowmobilers to enjoy their sport without harming the park and ruining the visitor experience Founded in by grassroots groups throughout the country Winter Wildlands Alliance is the only national organization working to protect a quality human powered winter recreation experience For more information contact Sally Grimes Executive Director at or visit www winterwildlands org Note to Reporters

economies BOISE ID A federal court ruling against the Bush administration s snowmobile plan for Yellowstone National Park will create short term hardship for some businesses outside Yellowstone but will be a boon to others and presents a rare opportunity for towns such as West Yellowstone to diversify their economies the nation s first and only organization representing non motorized winter recreationists said We understand there will be some local economic disruption as a result of this ruling but we also know skiers and other winter recreation enthusiasts will flock to Yellowstone and its gateway communities once snowmobiles are no longer in the park said Winter Wildlands Alliance Executive Director Sally Grimes Skiers have been telling us they re ready to return to places like West Yellowstone and we re confident they ll play a key role as the community expands its tourism base Winter Wildlands based in Boise represents more than million skiers snowshoers snowboarders and other non motorized snowsports enthusiasts It is the lone recreation group among the six plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit over the National Park Service s winter use plan for Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks U S District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan on Wednesday set aside the Park Service s plan to allow nearly snowmobiles a day into Yellowstone and Grand Teton reinstating a Clinton era plan to phase out snowmobile use in both parks The effect of the court s ruling is to reduce snowmobile use in the parks this year by half eliminating it next year The important thing for Yellowstone and for those who want to enjoy its natural beauty in the winter is to move ahead as soon as possible toward replacing snowmobiles with more snowcoaches to allow all Americans to visit Yellowstone in the winter Grimes said Yellowstone is not closed this winter nor will it be closed next winter All Americans will still enjoy access to this special place Now that the court has ruled it s up to all of us to work with the Park Service and the communities surrounding these magnificent parks to expand winter recreation opportunities in and around the parks Grimes said it s critical that the Park Service Congress local businesses and government leaders and snowmobile organizations work together to find new ways to draw more winter visitors to West Yellowstone and other gateway communities That includes askig Congress for more funds to expand the Yellowstone snowcoach fleet and to better educate the public on diverse winter recreation opportunities in and around Yellowstone For instance the Park Service was prepared to spend more than million in tax dollars this winter to assess snowmobile pollution levels and other impacts and to hire more law enforcement officers That money can now be used to expand local economies The visiting public needs to be made aware that tomorrow next week and throughout the winter they can continue to visit Yellowstone s popular attractions Grimes said Skiers and snowshoers will return and we think this can be a win win case for everyone It s our hope that rather than being known as just the snowmobile capitol of the world towns like West Yellowstone will become known as the Winter Wonderland of the world Other groups involved in the Yellowstone snowmobile case are Greater Yellowstone Coalition National Parks Conservation Association The Wilderness Society Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club The organizations were represented by Earthjustice Grimes said Winter Wildlands plans to hold its annual skier rally for Yellowstone as scheduled this Valentine s Day WWA expects more than skiers snowshoers and others to fill West Yellowstone hotels and restaurants over the long Presidents Day weekend as they did last year in a show of economic support for local businesses WWA officials will also seek to meet with local business leaders on how skiers can play a role in expanding the town s winter economy Founded in by grassroots groups throughout the country Winter Wildlands Alliance is the only national organization working to protect a quality human powered winter recreation experience For more information

has recently been discovered by growing numbers of off road vehicle users ORV advocates are well organized vocal and have been lobbying the BLM for greater access Intensive ORV use will have an adverse effect on the Shelf climbing experience degrade wildlife habitat and water quality and increase noise pollution and soil erosion The BLM is now in the process of deciding how much of the area will be available to ORVs and how much will remain wild and provide solitude The BLM has held two scoping meetings to identify important issues and develop alternatives and is now in the process of developing the Travel Management Plan Comments will be accepted throughout the planning process Please encourage the BLM to restrict ORV use to existing roads and most importantly not to allow their

Threatened Species Program The money is used by WWF to care for the many creatures that are currently under threat in the Australian landscape WWF Australia began its work years ago focused on recovery of threatened plants and animals Over the years WWF learnt that working to recover a single species is nowhere near as useful or effective as working on a landscape scale This means developing multi species recovery plans protecting habitat and fostering wiser management of our land and water resources Today WWF s Threatened Species Program encompasses all these activities and more In Australia today there are over species listed as threatened so the challenge is significant WWF uses a flagship species approach This involves pinpointing certain species to work on whose

ACROSS THREE STATES The eastern states were devastated over summer with a series of bushfires that started in November and were still burning in some areas as we went to print in late February Quite apart from the tragic loss of life and property that occurred in the towns and cities as the fires raged across three states the loss and damage to the bush and alpine areas has been enormous The outdoors community is reeling from the impact on a number of fronts Those who love the bush simply for what it is a beautiful natural zone that by and large hasn t been changed too much since European settlement are saddened and are feeling a certain sense of loss with the burning of such huge areas of our peaceful energy restoring natural environment The Mount Hay fire just one of dozens of the summer fires Photo Ian Brown The environmental impact has been significant and the extent of the damage is only now being evaluated Nick Gellie a landscape and fire ecologist says We ve lost a significant amount of biomass re sprouting will begin months after the fires but what we are afraid we ve lost is old growth and mature forest we ve lost things that characterise the snow gum country Animal losses are sure to be similarly horrifying although harder to quantify Debbie Andrew a biologist who studied the impact of the fires suggests that while plants and animals around Sydney and the Blue Mountains are in a better position to regenerate and recolonise sites because they are more accustomed to summer fires those in the alpine areas may take up to years to regenerate The statistics of the summer fires tell a dramatic story In Victoria a stunning million hectares was burnt this is a whopping of the state s parks and forests The year average for Victorian fires to late summer is usually fires that burn hectares annually this year until mid February there had been fires that consumed over a million hectares In NSW million hectares was burnt with over hectares burnt in Kosciuszko NP KNP alone This equals of KNP and compares with just hectares burnt last year in the park Access to bush areas has been seriously curtailed for a large proportion of Australian bushwalkers c ers canyoners and climbers Most of the Victorian high country and KNP much of the Blue Mountains including Wollemi Kanangra Boyd and the central areas and numerous parks and reserves scattered up and down the coast have been off limits for most of the summer Whole communities such as the paddlers of northern Victoria the walkers and canyoners who live in or visit the Blue Mountains and mountain bikers around Mount Beauty have all been left extremely frustrated as fires have kept them out of the bush Most land managers wouldn t put a timeframe on closures but it s safe to say that some burnt areas will be off limits for many months The main concern is trees falling on roads or walking tracks another concern is rehabilitation said John Ross a spokesman for the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service NPWS Ross says that previously threatened and closed areas will be progressively reopened A spokeswoman for the Department of Natural Resources and Energy in Victoria said that no roads or tracks will be closed indefinitely and that road closures are being assessed as the fire situation changes Infrastructure losses within the burnt areas have also been substantial In one go this is far and away the worst disaster we ve seen Some people are devastated to them it s just the same as having their own house burnt down said Olaf Moon from the Kosciuszko Huts Association when asked about the many huts claimed by the fires Total hut losses across Namadgi NP Kosciuszko NP and three Victorian parks currently stand at confirmed burnt another dozen or so highly likely to be lost and many more of unknown status The issue of High Country huts has been political in the past with some land managers showing reluctance to allow rebuilding of destroyed huts however this summer saw a good level of co operation as authorities threw resources at trying to save huts Some inspiring stories came to light including the NPWS RFS team who stood with their backs to the walls of Four Mile Hut to save it Literally the fire burnt right to the walls the earth around the huts is completely scorched said Moon Alina Brown and Lucas Trihey In May this website will host a series of articles concerning the ecological effects of fire with varied input from ecologists biologists and others CHECK LIST FOR VISITING FIRE AFFECTED AREAS Respect closures in burnt areas The danger from falling branches and trees is very high after a fire Erosion is also a major problem in sensitive areas as they slowly recover from fire damage Wandering stock beside roads due to burnt fences is a serious vehicle and animal risk Stay out of areas close to active fires it sounds obvious but you d be surprised at the actions of some Maintain a constant vigilance with c fires and stoves Ensure that they are properly extinguished and comply with fire bans again it sounds obvious but there have been some scary tales of negligence that have found their way to the Outdoor office Check the FIRE LINKS page on the Outdoor website Reference pages for up to date information on closures current fires and related topics STOVE FUEL BOTTLES ON PLANES NEW RULES The rules on taking c ing stove fuel bottles onto planes have been relaxed as long as some simple precautions are taken including removing all fuel and air drying the container The following is an extract from a document titled Significant Changes to the th Edition International Air Transport Association IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations These changes are claimed to have become effective January With operator approval in checked baggage only Liquid fuelled c ing stoves Provided that steps have been taken to nullify the hazard by draining and air drying the fuel container or rinsing the fuel container with cooking oil to raise the flashpoint then wrapping the fuel container in absorbent material and placed in a polyethylene or equivalent Where the liquid fuelled c ing stove is prepared in this manner it can be classified as non hazardous This seems to indicate that the operator still has discretion While reports from some travellers indicate that Qantas and Air New Zealand have been permitting fuel bottles

'Listen Up Program Death in the Snow An Avalanche Tragedy Transcript Part I Apr home page contact us search site map prayer request Death in the Snow An Avalanche Tragedy Transcript April Back to Main Page It s been the worst season for avalanche deaths in over years But those numbers do little to console a community that was hit especially hard The students of Calgary s Strathcona Tweedsmuir were on a school trip in the mountains of B C It was a character building adventure trip one that ended in a horrific tragedy Seven of those children never returned from that trip and today we talk to one of the victim s families A remarkable girl who led a remarkable life Meet Marissa Staddon These are of Marissa in her early days I think Karl took this one when she was just a couple days old And that s her one year old photo This is a picture of Marissa taken at the beginning of school for grade She looks you straight in the eye from whatever angle you re looking at this photograph Marissa started skating at three years of age She loved it She had great capacity and natural ability for it And a year ago was sort of the highlight of her skating time in that she did manage to go to Canadian junior national competition She glowed when she was on the ice This is Marissa with her younger sister Brittany who she loved and adored We had a lot of great times as family together This is in the mountains We started when they were very young taking trips to the mountains few more family vacation photos We went up Heart Mountain which is just east of Canmore by Lacktah s Arch Marissa was ten years of age at that time I think it s feet of net vertical Here she is at the top Memories of the mountains and a mountain that forever changed this family Headlines the helicopter the mountains in black and white Now the memories of mountains are very different This was Marissa s backpack that she took on the outdoor education trip where she was struck by the avalanche It was purchased new this year and fitted to her She was still wearing it when she was buried She was buried about two and a half metres below the surface wearing the backpack Tough going through it I will show you some of the articles that she had in that backpack on the day she was struck Karl and Donna Staddon have found themselves unpacking a storm of grief since their daughter Marissa s school Stratchona Tweedsmuir had it s outdoor education trip turned to tragedy At the time when we hear the news that Marissa was deceased Brittany s response at that time was oh I ve lost my very best friend and she said Marissa has taught me so much and I was looking forward to having her teach me more and more I m gonna miss her so And then she paused and a few minutes later Brittany spoke up and she said well wouldn t you know Marissa was always such a competitor and always looking to go for the gold and here she s won this race she s beat us all to heaven Seven students all years old died in the avalanche and sent their home city Calgary reeling It hits not just parents it hits siblings I mean this covers every relationship group siblings friends parents grandparents everybody felt a sense of loss Licia Corbella is an editor at the Calgary Sun You know that I don t want to use a clich eacute but it was an avalanche of grief First there was the shuttle astronauts that perished And then later that day there was another group of bright lights just disappeared And being that they were young people and such connected young people so involved in so many things it didn t seem that there was any person in this city who didn t know someone who knew someone who knew them Or who knew them personally Everybody just got that sick sense in their feeling of so much potential lost There was a deep sense of sombreness in the city It really made the whole city seem smaller in an odd sense Like a village Because everybody was connected in some way It was very well anytime young people die but to have at the same time all years old all grade students all of them remarkable young people with so much promise it was just shocking It s been Canada s worst season for avalanche deaths A mild winter created the most unstable snow pack Revelstoke had seen in thirty years A reality that claimed lives in days This is an avalanche transceiver All of the students and the adults on the trip would have been wearing one of these You put these around your waist and over your shoulder to keep them secure When the this is kind of like a key when its engaged in this you can see it starts to blink The number of blinks gives you a indication of the battery life And you travel with it in transmit mode And it sends out about every second a small radio frequency And in the event of an avalanche everyone who is above ground or above snow then switches their transceiver from transmit to receive And you then go about trying to locate with this the people that are buried go down to confirm exactly where they re at Because you don t want to dig a deep hole to find out that you dug three feet off of where they re located So this is how they are used And how some of the students were detected and saved as a result by the transceiver That day in Revelstoke it wasn t human activity that began the avalanche it was wind Over a kilometre long crack in the snow loosening itself from the mountain Experienced in wilderness trips the Staddons have gone over all the details of this tragedy We viewed Marissa s body at the funeral home and she looked very much at peace and at rest it gave us a certain measure of comfort that the avalanche itself hadn t caused he a lot of pain from what we understand and having flown over the site later that day she wasn t swept through trees she wasn t swept over cliffs but she was swept a long distance metres we re told from the point she was standing at or skiing at the time she was struck by the avalanche our firm belief is that while she was probably very frightened undoubtedly that she didn t suffer a lot of pain in the aftermath of the avalanche So we drove up to Roger s pass and Donna Brittany and myself together with Jordy Sheppard who was the Parks Canada incident scene commander and the helicopter pilot we flew over the scene for or minutes While we were over the scene and it will help us you know go back and locate the site pretty precisely where Marissa came to rest after the avalanche Could you see it from the air Absolutely it was a huge hole I mean most of the holes were huge Marissa was buried we re told metres down and so they dug out a big pit to reach out her body My understanding is that uh at the time of the avalanche the trip leader was buried save except for his hand which was above the snow we spoke with him the morning after the avalanche he said that he could feel himself blacking out so time was getting away from him as well and Rich and Abby being first on scene saw the hand and were able to scoop down to his face and restore his breathing helicopters were brought to bear over the scene in very short order there were professionals on the ground involved in the location digging and in attempted revival efforts and the kids dug as well the kids dug as well because there was a time lag between the time that the satellite phone call went out and the time Parks Canada arrived Further up the mountain where the avalanche started and you can see how much snow really fed into this avalanche my estimate and I ve also read that Parks Canada I believe have said they estimate in the thousands of tons of snow that came down Parks Canada personnel have also commented uh think in terms of speeds of km an hour I believe I m told and I can t recall whether it was or shovels were broken by the rescuers in trying to dig and extricate those that were buried by the avalanche so again it speaks volumes to the effort the Herculean effort of the rescuers to try to dig these kids out and revive them Marissa always had a disposable camera in her back pack so she could take pictures of her adventures and when we got her back pack back her camera was there and so we took it in and had the film developed and there s a photo here that would ve been taken the day before so on the Friday afternoon when they were out skiing and it s Marissa with the two other girls that were part of the group friends of hers and and it just captures them with great smiles and just enjoying their adventure So are you at peace that the school had done everything it could that this was not beyond acceptable Yes I am and the reason is that I have climbed for over yrs I ve taken advanced avalanche training I ve climbed in these sorts of conditions I had the privilege of travelling with this group of students together with the trip leader in the fall of and nothing came to light in all of our discussion on sun Feb nd with all of the personnel or subsequent to that date that has made me think that there was an error in human decision making I really think it s remarkable that the first person dug out had the satellite phone It s also incredibly remarkable that Rich and Abby husband and wife Rich Marshall and Abby Watkins uh were just ahead had passed the school group and had just missed it were able to come back and be the first persons on scene after the avalanche and if not for their efforts the consequences would ve been considerably worse then they are Karl as I m looking at the gear that she all had and I m thinking about this trip as it was about building character helping students learn how to conquer challenges explain to us what you think goes on in the psyche of a person as they learn to conquer nature I can speak from my own experience and I think most of the students if not all of the students were having similar experiences themselves It s great for building confidence it teaches you to prioritize weight is always an issue the backpacks teaches you to be aware of the environment that you re operating in These are transferrable life skills that you learn in the mountains Absolutely you develop a mind set of how you want to deal with risk and there s also for me and for most of these students that there s a sense of joyousness of being in the mountains you simply see things in the mountains that you do not see in the cities This is the sleeping bag that Marissa took it s one that I ve had for many years but is more than adequate for the purposes of this trip when we return Unpacking what Marissa held in her heart Part All the Calgary teenagers lost in the avalanche were seen as incredible young Canadians and Marissa Staddon lived life large And her friends were such a big part of her life They were a very close knit group They had fun together Studied together And they grew in Christ together They are a group of friends who keep each other accountable That was just so comforting as parents to know that the friends your daughter had were supporting and building helping her to build her relationship with Christ Marissa was an avid athlete not only in figure skating but also with school sports team sports Mainly volleyball badminton and track and field She loved track and field and did very well in relay and long distance And this particular photo was taken in June of her grade year Her friend gave us this photo And on it he wrote on track for the Lord And I just thought that was so wonderful Because that was indeed Marissa Marissa played piano Started taking lessons when she was years old She was currently working on her grade her grade level of piano She also played flute and clarinet and saxophone and also hand bells She used her music for relaxation And then she would go of to skating in the evening she went to the arena for two hours of skating each evening I love this photo Marissa went on last year with her graduation grade class from Glenmore Christian Academy in July to Mexico with Youth With A Mission They built a home for a needy family down there This picture was taken of Marissa on conjunction with her graduation of junior high in June of Its actually the dress she had on for the funeral as well How did you decide that Actually I talked with Brittany Marissa s sister and I said what dress do you think And she said oh mom her graduation dress She loved that I can remember her putting it on and swirling around and going ah this feels good Because both Brittany and I remember so well her joy with that we just decided that that would be the dress we would have for her funeral For her ultimate graduation For her ultimate graduation Perfect Yes We just knew it had to be a celebration and we also wanted to have the plan of salvation to be spoken that word to be given to all who were going to be there because Marissa lived her life solid in Christ and she was always happy to share with others about Christ the difference that was in her life and so we wanted the message of salvation Celebration Service clip Pastor Matheson God so loved you Marissa God so loved you That he gave his only Son Jesus That Marissa that you might not perish So that you may have everlasting life Marissa accepted Christ into her heart when she was years old it was one day when I had picked her up from pre school she attended a pre school at a local church and when I picked her up and put her into the van she said Mom I asked Jesus into my heart today And I said Oh Marissa I am sooo happy for you Marissa did go on being keenly attuned to things of the Lord reading her Bible praying everyday even through her teen years her Bible was always at her bed side and she read every night before she went to sleep Celebration Service Clip Where would you be without Him on this one Despair I think it would be despair but when when we hold onto God he understands our pain he understands our loss he understands our confusion we sometimes feel about all this too but uh there is not despair what we have is hope because um know that God will give us the strength to carry on and that we have the hope and the promise that we will be with Marissa again in heaven because we have asked Christ into our heart we have that commitment we have that assurance that we will be in heaven with God one day and that means that we re gonna be in heaven with Marissa too And that just puts a whole different turn on the grieving that we are going through on this journey because of the hope the wonderful hope that he s given us And when you made your farewell card for Marissa Karl you wrote it differently than most people can you tell us why The we uh look at some other precedent s maybe four or five and most of the other precedents were people who had lived to be maybe or or Marissa only lived to and I thought that was such a pathetically short amount small number and so I calculated the number of days including leap years it was days that sounds like a lot a lot better number So what we wrote in our card was born June th Heaven bound Feb st Precious days and they truly were very very special days we think around Marissa and donna and I were talking and you know I guess there s a couple things one is two scenarios one is we never had Marissa and the other is we had Marissa for that number of days which would you rather have No choice absolutely would take those days with Marissa the second question was Marissa ours or was Marissa God s gift to us for whatever reason and trusted to us to raise her up and it s the later she was God s gift Tribute clip from Celebration Service from a friend Youth pastor Eryn Moore There s no guarantees in life in terms of how long we ll actually live And I think that really caught a lot of our students off guard A lot them really struggled with it at first There was some anger there was some questioning about why God would allow something like this to happen Sometimes I think the best answer is no answer I ve seen God work through this tragedy in amazing ways but I couldn t say to these students God allowed Marissa to die so that these could happen I don t know if that was totally His will I don t know I know that our lives are short That God never promises us any time of life on earth Life is a gift This is an assignment for language arts when she was in grade eight It s a poetry project and they can choose any theme of their own that they would like and they have to write poems Marissa chose the theme of God When her sister when Brittany got this out of her closet and we read it through we realised how how wonderful this was for us to have now To have these poems Marissa wrote from her heart And they reflected her closeness with God Her walk her journey with God You have a favourite in here tell us why Yes I do have a favourite The favourite that I have is this free verse which is called A Fresh Start Would it be all right if I read it Sadly standing in shimmering sprinkling snow Shoulders down Face downward Emotionally down cast She ponders wonders cries Tears walking round her face Covering all in their course overcoming the sink before them Why is she alone Why out in the snow Out in the cold Kneeling Bowing Stumbling Fallen in the frost Hands grasp Eyes closed Heart welcoming She finds a Redeemer A Saviour A fresh start I reflect more on it through the lens of the avalanche I don t know that its prophecy but the parallels here are

'Yosemite Back to Homepage Yosemite The Nose in a day By Alard H fner Every time I looked up at El Cap in Yosemite Valley I thought to myself that is one huge piece of rock Marianne Pretorius and I climbed the Nose together in August It took us four days Mike Mason and Dermot Brogan started ahead of us and it took them days When one is on a big wall for four days one has to haul a lot of items up water food sleeping bags etc and thus the haul bag can weigh over kg This slows one s climbing down considerably because the haulbag needs to get pulled up at every stance When Hans said to me that he had a free day to go climbing I hinted that I was keen to climb the Nose and thus we made plans to climb it in a day As Hans had climbed the route times before he holds the record for most Nose ascents he knew the exact rack of gear needed The rack consisted of double caming devices from to two inch and one each of three and four inch A couple of quick draws and six nuts were taken mainly micro nuts One m rope two ascenders and some aiders liters of water some Power bars and peanuts We awoke at h am had breakfast and set off We started the climb at h am As I did not enjoy the first couple of pitches on my earlier ascent Hans led to Sickle Ledge I took the lead from there and led up the Stovelegs these pitches were named by Warren Harding who opened the route in when he used pitons made from the legs of an old stove as protection Hans simul climbed below me We passed one party of two climbers who happily let us by Hans lead the last Stovelegs pitch up to Dolt Tower with me jugging on the line he fixed It is quicker if the leader gets to a stance fixes the rope and the seconder juggs up and cleans the pitch We reached Dolt Tower in just over two hours which on the previous trip had taken us days Hans and Alard I led on towards El Cap Tower As I had been up the Texas Flake and the Bootleg Flake with Marianne we decided on doing the Jardine Traverse a slight variation to the route Three more pitches and we were at c four the half way mark on the route We sat for a couple of minutes ate some food drank some water and enjoyed the amazing view it was so cool Hans led the pitch up to the Great Roof then I led the Great Roof which took me minutes to lead and minutes for Hans to clean it thus taking min for that pitch I was leading using Hans super light aiders and whilst stepping up on a piece of gear one of the straps on the aiders snapped letting me drop about cm before it caught me again thus sending some adrenaline through my system This pitch has only been free climbed by Lynn Hill and Scott Burke IT LOOKS AMAZINGLY SUPER DIFFICULT I free climbed the next pitch called the Pancake Flake which has its name due to it being a thin flake that forms a super lay back crack Free climbing this pitch at about grade is exhilarating because one is about m up and there is great exposure We alternated leads most of the way to the top passing a team of four Italians on the second last last pitch We reached the top nine hours and twenty two minutes after we had started Brilliant This was my third time up El Cap and Hans sixty sixth time The walk down took hour and minutes It felt very good just to be able to sit in the car This is a super route with excellent cracks in clean solid granite Highly recommended I was very fortunate to be able to climb this route with Hans Florine For more info on Hans have a look at his webpage www speedclimb com El Cap in Yosemite with the approximate line of the Nose in blue History A typical ascent of the Nose which takes the average speed climber between and hours The first ascent of the Nose in and Warren Harding a bon vivant from Northern California spent days over months literally carving his route by drilling some expansion bolts into the sheer granite face infuriating environmentalists but fascinating just about everyone else Through newspapers and radio the entire nation followed intently as Harding and his team of two other climbers established four c sites on ledges along the way all of the sites linked by feet of rope secured by nearly pitons Hundreds of pounds of supplies were winched up by a clumsy device called the Dolt Cart a pull cart with two bicycle wheels The circuslike sight caused traffic jams on the main road below which at one point prompted a ranger to yell at Harding through a bullhorn Get your ass down from there In October a ranger demanded that Harding complete the climb by Thanksgiving or abandon it Finally on Nov after a continuous day push Harding staggered over the rim of the Nose It was not at all clear to me who was the conqueror and who was conquered Harding would say a year later I do recall that El Cap seemed to be in much better condition than I was So began the popularity of big wall climbing in the U S with Yosemite as the sport s epicenter and Harding as the free spirited forefather In late February Harding died of liver failure at age and as night fell on the Yosemite Valley on May some climbers gathered in a granite quarry behind an abandoned gas station in Bishop Calif to celebrate his life The diverse group included erstwhile rock stars such as Royal Robbins and Yvon Chouinard aging Vulgarians members of the famously hedonistic sect of climbers who have been part of the Yosemite scene since the s and big wall vagabonds who had hitched hundreds of miles Some recalled Harding s infamous drinking binges while others told salacious tales of his womanizing At the end of each of his first ascents for ex le a bottle of ch agne and a beautiful woman who had been ferried up a much simpler route would be waiting Though his skills didn t match those of his contemporaries Robbins and Chouinard Harding didn t care to work hard enough to improve Screwing is more enjoyable than drilling bolt holes he liked to say Nevertheless says veteran Yosemite climber Mike Corbett People were just drawn to him and no one s been able to match him He was so full of life So too was the Yosemite Valley While beachboys on longboards were proliferating along the Southern California coast in the early s Harding s antiestablishment band of climbers including boozers dopers and drifters was making merry some miles to the northeast After descending upon C the venerated four acre dirt patch just east of El Cap the climbers provoked park rangers by mooning tourists and stealing c ers food They held raucous parties long past midnight They were incorrigibly loud except when authorities asked them about matters like the whereabouts of pound bales of pot that disappeared from a smuggler s plane that crashed in the Valley in February For all their hedonism these wall rats were also supremely gifted athletes and left no rock unscaled in the valley By the early s every meaningful big wall route in Yosemite had been established and climbers turned to setting speed records By the mid s advances in climbing technique and gear had enabled climbers to reach the peak of the Nose in less than hours During an unprecedented hour climb in Jim Bridwell John Long and Billy Westbay ditched their haul bags and carried a mere gallons of water not to mention two packs of Camel straights which they lit up while on each of the route s pitches We thought we were so studly Bridwell says We didn t think about trying to set another record because the whole point was just to break hours These guys are a new breed What they re doing is phenomenal The first of this new breed which arrived in the Yosemite Valley in the early s included Peter Croft and Dave Schultz speed climbing pioneers who employed riskier techniques such as simul climbing in which two roped up climbers ascend together Croft and Schultz soon joined by Florine turned the Nose into the autobahn completing ascents in nine hours and minutes then then When Croft and a partner went sub five in Florine inquired about teaming with him to try to set a new record Croft agreed and in June the duo took the wall in Everyone thought what they did was mind blowing O Neill says I thought that record would never be broken Back to top Back to Homepage THE SHIELD ROPE SOLOED BY ALARD HUFNER By Alard H fner November My Friends and I were sitting in the Yosemite meadows looking up at climbers on El Cap when we spotted someone on this blank headwall That had to be the Shield it looked so exposed We were amazed that a climb even went up this piece of rock During the next couple of weeks I spoke to people who had done the route and they all said that it was a real fun route with lots of open space and exposure When Mike Marianne and Dermot had left the Valley I needed something to climb and so the idea to solo the Shield popped into my head I had never soloed a big wall before and only practiced rope soloing on two other occasions When I was learning to rope solo I had practiced on the first ten pitches of the Shield to Mammoth Ledges same first ten pitches as Free Blast and Salethe From here there are fixed lines all the way down to the ground When I was ready for the route I jugged up those lines with all my requirements for days I managed two pitches higher than the fixed ropes and as it was getting dark I set up the porta ledge and was comfy asleep when it started raining So in the dark and rain I had to re setup the porta ledge with the fly which was brand new and had not been seam sealed It kept raining until about in the morning The wind was blowing the whole ledge around I was not far from this little gully which the rain turned into a river This all made for an unpleasant adventure Most of the things got fairly wet during the night and as I had lost my enthusiasm to continue retreat was still possible as I was not to high so I fixed some lines and abseiled all the way down to the ground leaving the gear at my high point Spent the weekend re motivating in San Francisco and had loads of fun as it was Halloween The flight of the Albatross Monday I jugged back up the lines climbed some more pitches and set up the ledge below a big roof There were three American climbers on a route called Flight of the Albatross which runs parallel to the Shield and only about thirty to forty meters to the left Therefore I had some company as we shouted across to each other every now and then In the morning I lead the roof pitch which brought me straight onto the headwall The exposure started to kick in in a big way The Shield headwall starts about m up is blank slightly bulging slightly overhanging and smooth except for a thin crack seam running up it In many places copper heads and rurps baby pitons are the only things that will fit There were a lot of fixed copper heads so I did not have to place any which was good because I only had two spare copperheads anyway I did not clip the copperheads because in the event of a fall they would probably be ripped out and I would be unable to put in more This caused me to lead out several times This was the case when I was nearing the bolts but I could just not reach them There was some old sling tape around the bolt so I clipped my aiders into that and stood in them I was about to clip into the bolt direct when I heard this frightening tear and the next sensation was falling through the air upside down It was amazing how fast I thought about the last placement I had clipped if it would hold how far was I going to fall Thank goodness this old fixed aluminum piton held and I came to an upside down halt about eight meters lower than I was a few seconds earlier Thank goodness this rope soloing technique works I managed to get back up to the bolts making sure I clipped the bolts this time and then set up c To the left and right and up and down there was just blank rock with only this three or four millimetre wide crack seam leading the way Three pitches a day is about the going rate for A or harder when soloing and that s what I was managing on the headwall Going to the toilet can be an interesting affair The rules are climbers must carry a porta potty So one has to do one s business into a brown paper bag and then put this into the porta potty which can be a bucket with a lid or a large PVC pipe with lids Aiming into the paper bag is vital when on a porta ledge as soiling the ledge would not be fun as this is the kitchen the bed and the bathroom I managed to take another two falls higher up on the head wall when gear popped The one fall was about ten meters and as I was falling it was ripping out lots of the gear I had placed When I finally came to a halt all the popped gear slid down the rope towards me in this instance about pieces of gear I then went back up hammering in those pitons which I had been slightly reluctant to do as getting pitons out is more work Above the head wall ledges start appearing which makes biving sleeping much easier The penultimate pitch is a big fun roof and the last pitch a chimney The only problem I had was on the last pitch when I was hauling the last two pitches in one The fifi hook which was holding the haulbag in place would not release from the bolt so I had to abseil back down over the roof hanging in mid air a m up then pull myself back into the stance to release the bag to then jumar back up A couple of meters of grade four scrambling and I was at the TOP time for a beer Ahhhh after seven days climbing it felt great to be at the top The hike down was absolutely terrible having to carry all that equipment The route was opened in The speed record for the Shield from bottom to top is an incredible ten hours fifty eight minutes Two days later I left the valley for the last time on this trip as rain and the first snow fell Extreme Thanks go to Hans Florine Abby Watkins Dan Dunkal Craig Calonica and Dan Mc Divett who let me use and abuse their gear Here Alard is hanging in mid air and the picture is of the shadow of himself and his haulbag whilst on the

YOSEMITE The Big Walls El Capitan Half Dome North American Ice Colorado South America ARGENTINA PATAGONIA Last season brought a number of new routes and important ascents completed by parties travelling in a light and fast style Unfortunately one of the significant factors influencing parties to climb in this style was the season s abysmal weather Throughout October and November the Patagonian climate was as bad or worse than that seen in the past by many of the regular aficionados Some good spells occurred in early December and there were occasional fine days later but by the New Year things had gone dramatically downhill The snowfall increased to such an extent that the local population were shaking their heads and saying that they had not seen so much snow in the austral summer for more than years Not surprisingly there was noticeable strain amongst climbers based on the C o de Agostini formally the C o Bridwell as continuous bad weather led to many unaccomplished dreams Several visitors this year have been critical of the growing trend to claim routes which end far from the summit Some of these join other existing routes and others don t even get that far On the peaks of Patagonia it is generally the last few hundred metres that are unique As one of the protagonists put it the hardest metre in Patagonia is the last metre as you have to get there to climb it This is particularly true in the normally hostile environment of a region where a few extra hours in the face of an advancing storm can be some of the most terrifying in a climber s career It may be time once again to look at what constitutes or not a first ascent Cerro Pollone Italians Luigi Crippa and Lorenzo Nadali climbed a new route on the South East Face of this m peak northeast of Piergiorgio on the th October This was the first route to be completed in the Chalten region during the season Towards the end of Nadali with Mauro Giriadi and Andrea Sarchi completed Ensueno on the North West Buttress of Fitzroy to the right of the Supercanaleta and had a clear view of Cerro Pollone opposite It was at this time that Nadali saw a couloir splitting the triangular lower buttress of the face and resolved to go back and try it Crippa who is very good on ice numerous hard winter ascents and ice climbs in the Dolomites as well as incidentally a number of mixed routes on Ben Nevis seemed a suitable partner and the pair spent a week waiting for good weather before crossing the Passo Quadrado on the th October After sleeping for three hours they continued to the Passo dell Hombre Sentado close to the start of the climb The ice in the couloir was perfect and the lower four pitches went easily They then entered a section hidden from the base of the climb where the ice runnel narrowed to cm and on occasions was no more than cm wide and sometimes cm thick Above the rock pyramid at about half height on the face the route crossed much easier ground to the west before starting up the left flank of the final ridge The pitches were thinly iced and one required some aid but conditions were amazingly good allowing the pair to progress up thin terrain so thin they felt that were a similar situation to be found in their homeland it would be impossible for them to make any upward progress The last pitch was particularly run out and the pair reached the top one report states that the actual summit was not reached in fine weather and light winds Descent was made by rappel five in total following the upper half of the route and then by down climbing the glacier slopes behind the initial rock pyramid to reach their c on the th The new route christened Mastica e Sputa Chew and Spit was m long and given an overall alpine grade of ED sections of see topo A French pair female climber Laurence Bonoyer and Bruno Sourzac made the second ascent on the th December Piergiorgio In November December Italians Maurizio Giordani and Gian Luca R ikino Maspes attempted a new route up the middle of the North West Face Gringos Locos has pitches up to a and A but was terminated well short of the summit see INFOS and and the ropes left in place for a subsequent attempt That attempt was due to take place last December but when the pair arrived back at the base of the wall they found their fixed ropes shredded despite having taken stringent measures to tension them down Unwilling to go through the whole operation again they turned their attentions to a suitable alternative the unclimbed North East Ridge which forms the left skyline of the photos published in INFOS and Three difficult pitches led to the col between the Piergiorgio and Cerro Pollone where the pair bivouacked on the night of the th December The following day they moved on to the south flank and climbed m of mixed ground rock to a and A and ice to WI to reach the huge summit mushroom which is supposedly unclimbable The route was christened Esperando la Cumbre The North West Face was the scene of a brief attempt on a new route by the French team of St eacute phane Benoist St eacute phane Gauard Pierre Menats and J eacute r ocirc me Thini egrave res These four only managed to climb three pitches and reportedly drilled holes for bat hooks and rivets in only m of climbing before a fall to Gauard which injured his shoulder and leg forced the entire team to retreat and concentrate on evacuating the casualty Aguja Bifida Two new routes were climbed on this m doubled headed summit which lies on the ridge immediately north of Stanhardt The strong Italian team of Paolo Cavagnetto Roberto Giovannetto Manlio Motto Gianni Predan and Cesare Ravaschietto arrived in the region during December and hauled gear over the Passo Marconi and on to the Hielo Continental Although they had no fixed objective except to climb in the remote wilderness side of the range they chose the West Face of Bifida as it still had no lines at that date and other faces in the vicinity looked rather too dangerous The most well known member of the team Manlio Motto is undoubtedly one of the most prolific Alpine rock climbers in Italy He has created over routes mostly from the ground up and with high standard obligatory moves He is particularly noted for his wide use of bolts on the virgin compact rock of the Mont Blanc Massif and his numerous new routes throughout this region have been widely reported in these pages The most compelling line on the Bifida was an obvious diedre which rose to a notch just left of the main or North Summit not reached from any direction until when an Argentinian Swiss duo Bresba and L uuml thi climbed the North East Face a and A on mediocre rock Using fixed ropes on part of the route the Italians climbed the pitch line to the summit on the th th and th th of December The rock was found to be extremely good and the climbing marvellous Apart from the stances which were fully bolted one bolt and half a dozen pegs were used with the main source of protection coming from wires and Camalots up to No The climbing was mixed free and aid with difficulties up to b and A Italian and certain other Continental aid grades appear to be different from those widely used in the USA The rating depends entirely on the difficulty of the moves and not the fall potential The route was christened Hielo y Fuego given an overall Alpine grade of ED see topo and all members summited As the weather remained good the team decided to try another line up the pillar leading to the northerly foresummit more or less an independent summit This they completed from the th th with a bivouac at the top of the seventh pitch This pitch route christened Su Patagunia was again on superb and very abrasive rock though the climbing was perhaps not of the same high quality as Hielo y Fuego The climb finished on the crest of the ridge facing the Quatro Dedos and had maximum difficulties of b one short section of A Belays were again equipped and three extra bolts placed for protection On the th the weather turned for the worse and the team evacuated via Piedra del Fraile to Chalten They note that on this wild side of the range Hielo y Fuego is one of the few routes completed that actually reaches the summit ex les of those that don t include Gracias a la Vida on Punta Herron Cristalli nell Vento on Cerro Torre and Pepe Rayo on Piergiorgio Cerro Stanhardt The Anker Gerberding line of Tomahawk a direct start to Exocet up the lower wall of the East Face received its fourth ascent on the th January by the talented Spanish climber Simon Elias and fellow countryman Josu Merino The m ED route was found to give ice climbing up to and rock to and A as opposed to the a and A rating given by the French who made the second and third ascents The Spaniards had the assistance on the first two pitches of fixed ropes established by another party and climbed the route to within one pitch of the Exocet gully Cerro Torre Only one ascent was recorded of this prestigious mountain during the season and this proved to be the first complete ascent of the peak since the season Spanish climbers Simon Elias and Josu Merino reached the top on the th February having made the sixth ascent of Casimiro Ferrari s route on the West Face The Spaniards spent many hours climbing and digging through the m summit mushroom which turned out to be the most difficult and dangerous pitch of the entire route Several years ago during a filming operation which involved landing a helicopter on the highest point of the Torre a huge cave was dug in the top of the mushroom to accommodate the film crew and the entrance closed off with a door It appears that the hole must have caused a significant weakening in the structure and some time later the mushroom keeled over and from all directions presented a formidable challenge In the last few years parties have avoided climbing this last difficult pitch considering it either not important or impossible Later in the season veterans Maurizio Giarolli and Elio Orlando climbed nine pitches up a new route on the Torre but could not finish it due to the abysmal weather They left it fixed and plan to return this October Not surprisingly details of the exact line of the attempt are being withheld Aguja Guillaumet The Valtellina based climber Gian Luca R ikino Maspes made a solo ascent of the Argentinian Route with the variation by Maurizio Giordani who also climbed solo in just five hours on the th December This m line on the North West Face has difficulties up to a b and A Maspes used a backrope on only one pitch The Argentinian Route Comesa ntilde a Fonrouge and A although the original line to the summit of this m rock tower north of Fitzroy has not become the standard route that honour now reserved for the Brenner Moschini route on the North East Ridge and A However last season it appears the original route was repeated on several occasions as were the French Couloirs on the East Face Coquenoit Guillot and Amy Vidailhet climbed in Aguja Mermoz On the th December Giordani teamed up with Aldo Leviti a highly noted Dolomite climber with many elegant new routes to his credit to climb a new line on the North West Face to the right of the Argentinian Route North West Pillar Cuinas Vieiro m pitches Their line which was more or less m long climbed for pitches up the face to join the Argentinian Route on the summit ridge and had difficulties of c with a short section of A The summit m northeast of Fitzroy was not reached and the climb achieved in a continuous effort of hours from Base C to Base C Leviti has prefixed a number of his Dolomite test pieces with the name Iper e g Iperscotoni on the Cima Scotoni and therefore it was no surprise to find this Patagonian route christened Iper Mermoz Aguja Poincenot Only one ascent has so far been reported of this m summit south of Fitzroy and this was a new route from the American team of Greg Crouch and Jim Donini On the th and th December immediately after their climb on Rafael see below the pair set off for the North Face approached as for the Carrington Rouse Route on the West Face then continuing for a total of m of mixed ground to the base of the wall at the same point as the West North West Pillar first climbed in at a and A pitches by the Italian team of Bosisio Panzeri Della Santa and Vitali The arrival of a storm caught the Americans halfway up the face on the th and although they sat it out for the next two nights their food ran out and they were forced to retreat to a high c on the th A day later the weather improved and they set off again spending the night at the top of the fourth pitch and climbing the remaining the following day to the shoulder The difficulties thus far were rated and A and included hard off widths and tight chimneys see topo From this point the end of the difficulties the pair tired from seven days of continuous action continued for another three hours of pitching scrambling and intricate route finding to get to the summit By sunrise the following morning they were back at their bivouac ledge and after a few hours rest continued down to their c having left virtually their entire rack of rappel anchors but well pleased at having persevered to the true summit They named the climb The Old Smuggler s Route after the Argentinian whisky that kept them going through the times of bad weather For Donini this was another superb achievement coming after his new route in Alaska last year with Crouch see INFO years after his historic first ascent with Bragg and Wilson of neighbouring Torre Egger Fitzroy The first route to be completed during the season on Fitzroy was the Supercanaleta Supercouloir the m gash on the North West Face originally climbed in during the second ascent of the peak by Argentinians Comesana and Fonrouge The French pair Pierre Mahenc and Jean Philippe Tremblai despatched the route in two days over the nd rd of December There were short sections of ice and some rock at a The first ascent of the couloir was an impressive achievement for the era by climbers who were completely unknown outside of their own country The route resisted a second ascent until The standard route up the South East Pillar Franco Argentinian pitches normally climbed at b and A followed by mixed climbing up the summit ridge was climbed by a six man Russian team which spent days on the route summiting on the st February In January an Italian team from Trieste Carlo Bormolini Massimo Boni Mauro Petronio Angelo Pozzi Mauro Rontini and Marco Sterni climbed the huge North Diedre to give Tehuelche This m and pitch route was climbed in a final push of seven days It was mostly free up to a but with a short section of b and some A and A The team reported joining the French Route on the North Face less than m from the summit at which point they terminated their ascent in high winds and rappelled the route The Argentinian climber Rolando Garibotti now resident in Colorado had dreamed of making an Alpine style ascent of this route ever since copying the original topo at the park headquarters when a teenager of Last December he teamed up with American Doug Byerly to do just that The pair completed the climb in a hours push over the th th but found that the point where the Italians had stopped was some m from the summit the first three pitches of which still involved tricky mixed ground Byerly and Garibotti s first integral ascent of the route used no fixed ropes though the pair were dismayed to find the line completely littered with gear from the first ascensionists The Italians had apparently fixed the entire route and left m of rope in place Byerly and Garibotti cut away nearly of the years old decaying material and threw it down to the glacier together with a sack full of rotting clothing left on a stance They started out from a high c at am on the th in perfect weather but first had to ascend the Sitting Man Ridge a climb in itself with around m of moderate ice and sections of mixed terrain Climbing unroped they reached the top of this ridge in three hours and started up Tehuelche at am finding extremely enjoyable climbing and some of the best granite that either had ever touched On the first day they climbed with quite heavy packs containing bivouac gear and food for three days After pitches some of which were wet or icy they reached a big ledge called the Grand Hotel and stopped for the night Although it clouded over that evening the next day dawned fine and the pair continued up the Diedre de Marco named after Marco Sterni the star Italian rock climber who led the entire feature This gave the hardest climbing on the route and was often difficult to protect due to the off width nature of the cracks As the day continued warm the upper pitches became increasingly wet and the finish involved an A section up a now gushing waterfall Several pitches of climbing still in rock boots above the point where the Italians turned back led to easier mixed ground and eventually the true summit a thin blade of granite The weather remained stable and the pair made it back to the Grand Hotel that night for a few hours sleep before continuing down to the foot of the wall just hours after starting out The line which they comment involves some great free climbing was completed at b and A see topo Aguja Rafael Inominata Doug Byerly and Rolando Garibotti made the fourth ascent of the original Anglo American Route via the West Face and South Ridge Boysen Braithwaite Dickenson Reid USA Sylvester USA a on the nd December This gives m of splendid and sustained climbing and was the second time Garibotti had climbed the route he made the third ascent in with American Charlie Fowler This time the pair climbed a new four pitch variation to give the route an overall technical grade of b and A On the same day Americans Greg Crouch and Jim Donini attempted the first ascent of the West Ridge hoping the route would go easily in the day as a warm up for the season it didn t After pitches of difficult mixed climbing and rather convoluted route finding plus a bitterly cold open bivouac they joined the Anglo American route at the notch some six pitches short of the summit Unable to continue above this point due to sheer exhaustion and dehydration the pair retreated The line had difficulties of and A plus ice mixed to but because of their commendably high ethical standards where any Alpine route is not completed unless the summit is reached the pair do not consider this a new route though many current Patagonian activists might and have declined to name it Rather it simply felt like we had gotten our butts kicked by one of the smallest peaks in the range Aguja St Exup eacute ry South of Rafael this m rock tower received at least three ascents last season two from Garibotti The day after their ascent of Rafael Byerly and Garibotti headed back up for an attempt on the Giordani Valentini line Chiaro di Luna on the m high West Face However due to very cold conditions the pair could not start the climb until midday and then were forced to use aid on the initial cracks which were very iced Once they moved on to better rock conditions they speeded up and managed to reach the summit in hours just before dark after a total of pitches up to c Rappelling through the dark the rope jammed at around am and the pair sat out a very cold night before easily freeing the offending rope in the daylight and continuing safely down to their c the following morning Around on the East Face two members of a Russian team climbed the superb m East Pillar used to make the first ascent of the tower in by the Italian team of Buscaini Condot Metzeltin Romano and Sinigoi m and A climbed all free at c except for one short aid section by Schwitter and Ishibe in The pair reached the summit on the th December One day later during a hours period of good weather after a long spell of bad Garibotti moving light and fast managed to solo the Harrington Kearney Route m a on the North West Face Due to the previous poor weather the conditions were icy which made the climbing slow as each hold had to be checked for verglas Even so Garibotti climbed mostly unroped self belaying only a few sections and reached the top in fours hours He was back at c for afternoon tea Aguja de la S In addition to the climbs reported in INFO Pablo Besser and the Argentinian Gadi Slomka repeated the Austrian Route B auml rnthaler Lidi on the East Face of the Aguja de la S m one of the smallest granite peaks on the main ridge several kilometres south of Fitzroy From a bivouac at the edge of the glacier above the Rio Blanco Base C the pair made their ascent on the th February in excellent weather climbing first three snow pitches at c and then the rock pitches above at b and A The rock section follows a prominent diedre offering predominantly wide cracks in excellent granite The climbers replaced all the rappel anchors on their descent It is perhaps interesting to note that Hans B auml rnthaler who made the first ascent of this route and was active in both Patagonia and the Himalaya in the late s routes include a first ascent on Aguja St Exup eacute ry plus the Voie Normales on Cho Oyu and Xixabangma Main Summit was tragically killed in on the Austrian K East Face expedition Bad weather prevented the team from making much progress and while B auml rnthaler was climbing a small peak on the opposite side of the glacier in order to take photographs of the face he was swept away by a windslab avalanche El Mocho The squat rock tower at the foot of the South East Ridge of Cerro Torre received at least four ascents during the season The French duo Bonoyer and Sourzac with fellow countrymen Pierre Mahenc and Jean Philippe Tremblai made an ascent of the Central Ice Gully climbed in by Grassi Pe and Rossi and christened All or Nothing but often referred to as the Grassi Goulotte The two French pairs climbed the m TD route up the East Face on the th November Later on the th December Byerly and Garibotti attempted this line but found it too dangerous as a result of the recent warm weather On the th December the Swiss pair Denis Burdet and Jean Zweiacker made a relatively early repeat of the Anker Piola route Voie des B eacute nitiers on the South Pillar this route had its second ascent on the st December This m route pitches on the pillar followed by the summit ridge was originally graded F c and A b obl though is now considered c and A The route was climbed again on the th January by Rolando Garibotti and Gian Luca Maspes Cerro Marconi Norte Maurizio Giordani climbed a new route solo on the north flank of this peak above the Passo Marconi on the th December The m line had maximum difficulties of PUNA DE ATACAMA The highest peaks in Chile and also those in Argentina apart from Aconcagua lie near the southern limits of the Atacama Desert and are rarely visited due to the extreme isolation and lack of water The Atacama is commonly considered the world s driest desert area There has been a long debate as to whether Pissis or Ojos del Salado the latter often referred to as the highest active volcano in the world is the second highest summit in the Americas after Aconcagua Recent accurate Argentinian surveys give the benefit of the doubt to Pissis and the Argentine IGM sheet III at the only accurate topographical map in existence to feature both summits now marks Ojos as m and Pissis at m There may of course be a little political skulduggery there as Ojos lies on the border with Chile whereas Pissis is entirely within Argentina Any controversy may well be eliminated after August when Mike Jenkins takes his team of British Military Surveyors from the Royal Engineers to climb Ojos together with a group of like minded Chilean surveyors In Jenkins and his team climbed Chimborazo and made a complex differential GPS survey of the mountain arriving at an altitude of m some m or so lower than the long accepted height The Ecuadorians were so impressed with this technique that they now use the new height on all their official maps see INFO The Argentinians used identical techniques to come up with the height of m for Pissis in see INFO but Ojos has yet to have any such treatment and may yet prove the higher mountain Jenkins compares today s military surveyors to the old Survey of India team who first explored many of Asia s high peaks in the last century Names such as George Everest Colonel Montgomerie and Kenneth Mason ensure a proud tradition of military surveyors and one which still compels the modern day descendants to travel to unknown lands In October November three British mountaineers Gordon and John Biggar plus Richard Wilkins made some interesting first British ascents in the region including Pissis The team approached the largely snowless mountains from the village of Fiambala in Northern Argentina and first made an ascent of the very rarely climbed Cazadero m which lies to the southwest of Ojos and is also known as Walther Penck The volcano was originally climbed by Japanese in and only appears to have received one ascent since by a group from Chile in The British team climbed the easy northern slopes All three then made an ascent of the Argentinian side of Ojos del Salado reaching the summit on a cold and windy st October The group then transferred the km south to Pissis and made the ascent on the th November via the North Glacier from a high c at m Those final c m took only six hours in near perfect weather a particularly notable achievement for Gordon Biggar and Wilkins aged and respectively Pissis was first climbed by the Poles in with a second ascent not recorded until Two Americans Kent Pierce and Stuart Richie who reached the top on the th February this year at the end of a days stint in which they climbed all three highest summits in South America Pissis reached by a remote cross country drive involving an unauthorized border crossing in to Argentina found the summit register to contain entries for less than ascents since This lack of attention may soon change if the label second highest peak in the Americas is widely accepted Most ascents appear to have been made either by very small parties or solo John Biggar who has made ascents of over of the highest peaks in the Andes and is the author of the recent publication The High Andes A Guide for Climbers went on to solo three more of the volcanoes Olivares m Majadita m much further south of Pissis and Nacimiento del Jague m The latter is a subsidiary summit of Nacimiento m immediately south of Cazadero and was possibly unclimbed before this ascent CHILE Hielo Patagonico Sur Following our brief report in INFO on the Arved Fuchs Expedition to cross the Hielo Patagonico Sur the Southern Patagonian Ice Cap and explore the Falla de Reichert we can now give more details on the climbing that took place on the Ice Cap to the east of the Fiordo Peel Fuchs perhaps best known for his Trans Antarctic crossing with Messner in and his claim to be the first man to walk to both North and South Poles within months had sailed from Canada in his yacht Dagmar Aaen with a crew of Germans one Alaskan and one Icelandic girl They were joined in Valparaiso by Chilean mountaineer Pablo Besser on the st October After considerable bureaucratic problems with the Chilean government they all set sail for Canal Baker and the Jorge Montt Glacier at the northern end of the ice cap While Fuchs and team began their journey south the boat sailed to the Peel Fjord and Besser with the Icelandic girl Sigga Ragna Sverrisdotir an excellent ice climber travelled over km in an inflatable dingy to the head of the Peel There they climbed up a steep and previously unexplored glacier christened Margarita Glacier on to the ice cap Pulling days food and equipment on pulks they finally reached the Japan Plateau and headed east for two days to make their first Base C near to the Malaspina Mountains From there they climbed Cerro Centinel m in poor conditions and Cerro Dagmar Aaen m the latter in soft snow ending with a m ice pitch and a classic Patagonian mushroom After a spell of bad weather they moved c to the base of Cerro Immaculado m where they made the first ascents of Immaculado Mirador del Hielo m Punta Ilusion m and Punta Aparicion m These have now been adopted as official names and heights on versions of maps to the area Besser and Sverrisdotir were also the first to cross the Garcia Glacier and Col m or Corredor Chileno Fuchs with team members Till Gottbrath and Roger Schmitt met up with the pair on the th November but a day storm which destroyed one of the tents put paid to the journey further south and the entire team traversed the Falle de Reichert Mayo Fall a c m chasm of seracs cutting the ice cap never before crossed except by helicopter and reached the Peel Fjord on the rd December While completing this route Besser Gottbrath Schmitt and Sverrisdotir made the first ascent of Cerro Cuatro Vientos The significance of the Arved Cross is that it was the longest north south traverse of the ice cap yet made without helicopter support or mid journey stop for a rest and re stock Besser hoped to return with three friends and make the first complete traverse of all km of the Hielo Sur during the season but the outcome of this proposed expedition is still unknown An interesting west to east traverse of the ice cap took place in March when Germans Carsten Birckhahn Merten Puschmann and Tilman Steinhardt took just over four weeks to travel from Peel Fjord to the Lago Argentina They first reached the fjord with plastic kayaks and then using them as pulks dragged their equipment m up on to the ice cap and continued east Their original project was to carry on down via the Santa Cruz river all the way to the Atlantic coast but it is thought that this part of their novel journey may well have been aborted Paine Due to the counter productive act by CONAF still in operation during the season of charging a high fee for climbing in the National Park only teams registered to climb during the entire six months of the austral summer Perhaps as a consequence of this and due also to continued foreign pressure the authorities reduced the fee previously per climbing team to per person for the season Although far from a perfect solution to the problem the new fee does encourage small teams in the area though the authorities still make no attempt to provide a service for the royalty News from the past season is still scanty though there has been a new route but not to the summit on The Shield a hard big wall route on the East Face of Cerro Cota in the Frances Valley and a second ascent of the Thomas Turner line Caveman on Cuerno Norte in the same valley For the moment we take the opportunity to catch up on previously unreported ascents from early The Towers After completing the Arved Cross Expedition described above Pablo Besser arrived at Paine in January Besser epitomized most Chilean nationals at the time in that he was furious at suddenly having to pay in order to climb in his own country He made two attempts on the South Tower by the North Ridge the original Aste Route c m F and A but was defeated by the weather However as a consolation he managed to climb the ever popular Monzino Route which forms the original and classic route of ascent on the South Ridge of the North Tower with Englishman Martin Chester on the th The two climbed the m route above Col Bich in a fast three and a half hours at VI and A Also in the Paine during January and February was the American team of Scott Lazar Michael Pennings and Cameron Tague These three first made the second ascent of the Piola Sprungli route Ultima Esperanza m b and A on the West Pillar of the North Tower s South Summit They climbed the route in a day with a three pitch variation at a grade of c and A Later after three days of preparation the same three climbed the West Face of the Central Tower by the Italian route Via de las Mamas Barbolini de Dona Pozzi R ini Veghetti m b and A This was the second ascent Finally they completed the trilogy by reaching the summit of the South Tower via the original but still infrequently ascended Aste Route Earlier the little repeated British Route on the Central Tower Bonington Whillans m best free attempt now b with some aid but thought to be possible at a b received an ascent in Alpine style by the strong German Australian team of Carsten Birckhahn and Andrew McAuley They climbed the route in December and are thought to be only the third party to have summited the Central Tower without a bivouac Afterwards the same pair were reported to have climbed the North Tower twice first by the Monzino Route and then by making the second ascent of The Corn Wall the South West Rib climbed in by Celia Bull Leigh McGinley and Paul Pritchard at b pitches to the junction with the Monzino Route The Pingo Valley In the Pingo Valley which runs north from Lago Nordenskjold to the South Tower and gives access to the East Faces of the Cuernos the Chilean pair of Sven Bruchfeld and Christian Oberli made the first ascent of the East Face of Hoja in January This pitch c m route was climbed in classic style using fixed ropes at a reported grade of a and A In February the Americans Pennings and Tague also turned their attention to the valley first climbing the m high East Face of Cuerno Este via a line graded and A and then a route on the East Face of Hoja which they christened Anduril the relation between this and the Chilean Route a month previously is unknown This last climb was completed in a round trip of hours from the valley and was almost entirely free The first climb ever to be achieved from the Pingo Valley only took place in the East Face of Cuerno Norte Last year three parties succeeded on four routes Apart from those just described a team of young Germans were successful in completing the first ascent of Cuerno Principle s East Face see INFO Note Last minute correspondence following interviews with several Italian climbers involved in some of the routes mentioned in this report suggests that comments regarding whether or not summits were

to the north of the Jankho Kkota valley in which the British party climbed are referred to as the Warawarini and Keakeani groups on the new Cordova map However the American cartographer Liam O Brien has made extensive research into this region delineated in the north by the Chachacomani Pass c m south of the Chachacomani Massif and discovered that the highest summit Pt m first climbed in by Japanese repeated in by O Brien and then again in by the British party should strictly be called Jallawaya I after the main river valley that drains the mountain to the south Following the convention of naming a group of mountains by the highest peak he proposes that this whole range of mountains which probably contains around summits over m should logically be named the Jallawaya Group German climbers Edi Birnbacher and Stefan Wiebel chose to visit the Jallawaya Negruni region in February This is the austral summer the rainy season and a time in which few ever visit the mountains However the German pair were aware that in recent years glacial recession had been significant and steep faces melted quickly with the arrival of the customary fine weather in late May June leaving vast areas of bare rotten rock although not all the granite in this region is poor Certainly by mid June many of the couloirs used by parties that made the first ascents of these fine peaks in the early s are now snow free stone swept chutes While the Germans found large quantities of snow on the mountains and acceptable conditions for mixed climbing they unfortunately coincided with the worst wet season for years and experienced copious amounts of bad weather On the th February they climbed a new route Pan Duro on the right side of the South West Face of Cerro Culin Thojo South m This m high mixed climb had rock difficulties of IV and snow ice to Three pegs were left in the rotten rock Two days later they climbed Andal eacute a m mixed route up the North Couloir of Pt m to the west of Cerro Ventanani Again the rock was poor IV maximum and the snow ice climbing between with one section of Finally on the th the pair climbed the East Face of Pt m the location of which is unclear though it is described as a subsidiary peak of Wila Lloje The m climb christened Caramba which involved rock to IV and snow ice to was again primarily composed of loose blocks and the ubiquitous rotten rock Two pegs and a sling were abandoned on the climb All these peaks or sub peaks lie close to the valley and most probably received their first ascents during when two large German expeditions explored the region However it is quite possible that the recent exploration by the two Germans produced the first new routes ever climbed in the Cordillera during the summer On the th a big landslide destroyed the WD access road which now continues over the Paso Mullu and down to the jungle villages Birnbacher and Wiebel had no option but to walk out to the main highway a distance of km Despite this they

Juan Villarroel Queen Maud Land In Ivar Erik Tollefsen led a Norwegian expedition to Dronning Maud Land on mainland Antarctica The expedition gained considerable media attention and produced a fine book which detailed the various stages of the project including the first ascent from the th January th February of Ulvetanna m via a m climb up the North West Face VIII and A The route was climbed in capsule style by Robert Caspersen a very talented rock climber and one of Norway s former indoor ch ions the very experienced Sjur Nesheim and Tollefsen In late Tollefsen again led a small team to Queen Maud Land this time to the Sor Rondane a region of mountains never previously visited by a climbing expedition Together with a four person media team Tollefsen Caspersen Aslak Aastorp and H aring kon Staver first flew by chartered Hercules from Cape Town to the Fenrisskjeften on the Icecap the venue for the expedition From there a ski equipped twin otter aircraft took the team km east to a Base C in the mountain range of Sor Rondane From here they spent days climbing the m high South East Face of Rondespiret Rondespiret is a Trango Tower like granite peak and the four climbed the obvious pillar and corner system on the left side of the face in sustained pitches of mixed free and aid climbing up to new wave A and VI see topo Extremely strong winds combined with cold stable weather caused many problems especially on the lower half of the route On Ulvetenna in Caspersen and team had found the granite often loose and friable due no doubt to the harsh and variable climatic environment This time the four Norwegians again climbing in capsule style found mostly good steep granite with a few notable and serious exceptions and completed the route from the rd December th January INFO Aslak Aastorp North America ALASKA Kichatna Spires As reported in INFO two new routes were completed in the Alaskan Cathedral Range more popularly known as the Kichatna Spires during June by years old American Calder Stratford and British climber Kevin Thaw Thaw who took up partial residence in the USA in the late s and is now more or less resident there was the first British climber to lead consensus A with his ascent of Sea of Dreams on Yosemite s El Capitan in The pair were flown into the unfrequented region south of the McKinley group on the th May and deposited on the Tatina Glacier Heeding the advice that when the unpredictable weather sets fair in this region climbers should not waste any time there are no real hours of darkness at this latitude until August the pair set out for a fine granite wall on an unnamed m peak immediately west of Tatina Spire The south buttress of what they later dubbed Punter s Peak gave seven m pitches to the interminable summit ridge This in turn offered easy Fifth Class climbing with the occasional boulder problem Two days were spent on the buttress and ropes were fixed single bolt belays on to the headwall where flaring cracks and loose exfoliating flakes gave more free climbing Three of the pitches crossing a series of roofs were entirely on aid modern A with much use of copperheads and skyhooks The free climbing standard on the rest reached a maximum of The route was christened Dreams of Sea and given an overall V rating The weather turned bad for the next days or so then miraculously cleared three days before the pre arranged flight out Stratford and Thaw quickly assembled gear for an attempt on a southern satellite of Tatina Spire and starting just right of the lowest point of the south buttress free climbed the often lichenous wall which prompted the route name Alaskan Rose to the golden headwall This formed the crux and had some run out climbing with a steep crack trough at c More lichen forced them out left into a corner system near the top They reached the summit after a total of nine long pitches placing single bolt belays backed up with rivets Alaskan Rose was also rated V Though these two routes were fairly short they were probably the steepest that the valley had to offer Cathedral Mountains Not to be confused with the group of spires above this small isolated range of peaks which appear to offer fine granite walls up to m high lie west of Mt Foraker and until last year had not previously been visited by any climber It was therefore perhaps rather apt that the first party into the region should have as one of its members the greatest of all American pioneers the indefatigable Fred Beckey Together with Calvin Herbert and the well known big wall guru John Middendorf Beckey who has now climbed over new routes in North America attempted the unnamed highest summit in the group The only real technical piece of climbing involved a loose rock wall to gain the fine summit snow ridge Beckey led this pitch and in deference to the years old living legend the other two climbers propose the name Mount Beckey for the m summit Mount Foraker Jeff Benowitz soloed a new route on a spur that lies between Mt Crosson and the Japanese Route through the North East Icefall Benowitz reached the crest via a m couloir on the north flank in order to bypass the loose rock buttress that terminates the spur He then continued for pitches all of which he backroped up the narrow corniced crest to an easing in difficulty Continuing unroped Benowitz reached the crest of the Sultana Ridge at c m Due to poor weather throughout his time on the mountain the hours of climbing that Benowitz spent in completing the route now christened The Way was in fact spread over six days The Japanese Route climbed during the third ascent of the mountain reaches the crest of the Sultana higher up While it is technically straightforward and has been repeated on several occasions it is very prone to snow and ice avalanches McKinley Apart from Steve House s ascent of the Washburn Wall reported in INFO another new route was climbed on the Great One during Slovakians Juraj Hreus and Jan Surcek started climbing parallel to the Messner Couloir then traversed up and left past Bugs McKeith s solo climb McClod s Rib and Scott Johnston s Hourglass Couloir to reach the series of rocky ribs on the North West Face lying above the traverse out to Denali Pass on the Standard Route Twenty five pitches of mixed ground from up these ribs led to the summit ridge Wrangell Mountains Paul Barry David Hart Harry Hunt and David Lacey climbed a new route on the m Mt Natazhat The four climbers followed the c km crest of the North East Ridge from a starting height of m A narrow corniced ridge led over Pt m and Pt m before reaching the final m summit ridge which proved to be the crux of the climb Their ascent also proved to be only the second of this mountain St Elias Range Mount Miller Carlos Buhler Paul Claus Ruedi Homberger Reto Ruesh and Charlie Sassara made the first ascent of the highest remaining unclimbed peak in the St Elias Range From an airdrop at only m on the Bagley Icefield the five climbers tackled a broad south facing spur leading up on to the crest of the West Ridge of Miller at c m They then followed the increasingly difficult crest for five and a half kilometres to the m summit successfully negotiating the crux section over a steep icy dome The route which had a vertical interval of over m was climbed in a continuous hours Coastal Range Devil s Thumb Spanish climber Sim oacute n Elias and American Chad McMullen climbed a new route on the North West Face of the Cat s Ear Spire the neighbouring rock tower to the Devil s Thumb close to the border between Southern Alaska and British Columbia After an initial ice couloir with a step of over a rimaye leading up to the notch below the North West Pillar where they made a first bivouac the pair climbed on the right flank of the ridge with a second bivouac to the summit The initial section was a and A then the route continued free with passages of The total length of the climb was m The pair were then joined by Jeff Selvig for an unsuccessful attempt on the South West Diedre of the Thumb The route started with m of vertical rock a just left of the crest of the South Pillar then worked up left to reach the huge diedre in the middle of the face a and A maximum After m of climbing and one bivouac the trio were less than m from the summit when it appears that a rockfall hit the ledge where they had left their bivouac gear and carried away sleeping bags Not wanting to risk a night out unequipped in the prevailing low temperatures the team decided to retreat This spectacular granite monolith was first climbed in by Beckey Craig and Schmidtke INFO Kevin Thaw YOSEMITE The Valley experienced a ravaging wet year in The season had barely started when a huge storm hit the area Several feet of snow then began to melt quickly in the warmth of May and the resulting run off caused the rivers to flood The Merced burst its banks causing havoc in the c grounds and washing away both possessions and aspirations of visiting climbers Perhaps not entirely unrelated to this deluge was the huge rockfall on the th July from close to the rim above Glacier Point Apron This event which has already been well reported in a previous High flattened one and a half metre diameter trees nearly one kilometre away and killed one person The fall left everything covered with large quantities of dust and a huge area of scarred earth with unstable boulders perched high above the Apron The Park Authorities closed the area from Goodrich Pinnacle east which includes routes on the Mouth and the Cow and also the line of Galactic Hitchhiker perhaps the longest free rock climb in the USA completed in the autumn of by Matt Brooks and Lou Renner at VI a b This route described in High has pitches to the rim out of which are new It remains to be seen whether routes such as these are still entirely intact To add insult to injury the season ended with the usual if somewhat premature snowfall However this was later followed by a warm wet storm For the second time in a year the Merced broke its banks and welled up over the valley floor this time creating the biggest flood in history with considerably more devastation than its spring counterpart Several c grounds were totally washed away as was a sewerage line and many large boulders were deposited on various roads around the park The Cookie cliff suffered considerable fresh rockfall as did many of the other crags which line Highway between El Portal and the Valley The worse flooding appears to have been caused by debris clogging up the watercourse at Pohono Bridge near to Bridalveil Falls The resulting dam forced water back in to the Valley and briefly closed all the Park exits At one stage Yosemite Lodge Yosemite Village and Curry Village were all isolated from one another by flood water A large boulder destroyed the dining room of the Parkline Restaurant at El Portal and the rest of the building was burned in order to prevent debris from creating another blockage Both Pines c grounds the River c grounds and the Housekeeping area suffered major damage and some of these may never re open However Sunnyside the traditional climbers c is some distance above the river and appears to have survived relatively unscathed The Park remained closed from January March and although at the time of writing details of the current situation are unknown the repair cost has been estimated at around There is a rumour that the Park Service may try to introduce a system of one day permits for visitors though whether this would effect climbers attempting multi day routes is unsure The Big Walls El Capitan Our report in INFO concerning the second and third ascent of Dante s Inferno contained several minor errors The second ascent was made by two Americans and not Scandinavians as stated and took five not four days The third ascent by the Danish climber Ravn Hamberg and the Swiss Aischan Rupp which resulted in the first one day ascent began at am with the pair carrying one small rucksack between them Also omitted from the report on the previous autumn s activities was probably the first single push ascent of El Capitan s Aquarian Wall in hours during October by Rupp and the Argentinian climber Rolando Garibotti Rupp was back in the Valley again in early summer and teamed up with the Norwegian Lofoten Islands expert Odd Roar Wiik to make the fifth ascent of the hard test piece Jolly Roger This route was first climbed in by Charles Cole and Steve Grossmann but has seen few subsequent attempts let alone repeats second ascent in days by the late Xaver Bongard from Switzerland climbing solo third by the well known American Brad Jarret also climbing solo fourth in by the Slovenians Janez Jeglic and Miha Prapotnik The Swiss Norwegian pair climbed the pitch route VI A which begins above the Mammoth Ledges on the South West Face between The Shield and Son of Heart in seven days from the th to the th June Their ascent was made in Alpine style without fixing ropes The pair used epoxy putty to reinstate much of the original hard climbing by filling up many of the drilled holes added after the Cole Grossman ascent As one activist said there have been a mistaken few in the past who have sought out glory on the big walls and reduced the commitment by drilling for security Sadly Rupp was killed earlier this year in a rappel accident while descending the Hornli Ridge on the Matterhorn having just completed a very fast winter ascent of the North Face Born in from mixed German Tadjikistan parentage Rupp was no newcomer to the Yosemite scene having visited the Valley on a regular basis over the past few years and had completed big wall routes on El Cap His tally included the first solo and fifth overall ascent of Native Son VI A to the right of The North America Wall Gulf Stream routes on the South East Face climbed in in the sixth ascent of Aurora VI and A with Oyvind Moss and in the first single push ascent of Sunkist VI A in hours with Garibotti the route had received less than ascents at the time In the same year he made a nine hours ascent of the Salath eacute Wall also with Garibotti Perhaps falling into the category of climbers who have reduced the commitment by drilling for security is the pair who completed the now controversial Wings of Steel They were busy drilling on El Cap for over a month with the drill heard on a daily basis Even a Park ranger was prompted to turn out to discourage their cause This route seems to avoid any available features instead taking a blank plum line directly up the wall The tactics apparently used were to drill small holes into which copperheads could be pasted The second would then consistently chop the head cables flush with the rock rendering each placement useless for a subsequent ascent In contrast a highly praised event in May on which no additional drilling appears to have taken place was the second ascent of the infamous offering from Randy Leavitt and the late Rob Slater named Scorched Earth Chris Kalous and Chris Righter spent five days completing this VI A route The crux pitch the Big Brother involves hard copperheading in rotten rock and a single hook move requiring a device which Leavitt dubbed a Lovetron Kalous and Righter also used their version of a Lovetron a tent pole with a steering wire and a skyhook attached to the end for an extremely long reach Later Kalous and Rubecca Rusch had made another important second ascent when they spent seven days climbing Bermuda Dunes VI A Kalous kept a busy big wall schedule in In March he made a solo winter ascent of the Cap starting up the first eight pitches of Lost in America VI A then making a short traverse on to Tangerine Trip VI A finishing on the summit after a total of nine days on the face He and Righter also took their experience to the Cirque of the Unclimbables in the summer and with Kevin Daniels and Gregg Epperson added another hard wall route Grendel VI A to Mount Proboscis Sadly the late spring was also the scene of a fatality on El Cap when American Mathew Baxter was killed while attempting to solo Zenyatta Mondatta Baxter took what should have been a short fall on the third pitch but his backrope got jammed behind a flake and cut through After the spring water had subsided years old San Francisco climber Chris McNamara completed Sea of Dreams VI A with Mark Melvin and Wyoming Sheep Ranch VI A with Eric Sloan Another successful ascent of this last named route was made by Wally Barker Returning from a productive trip to Baffin Island where with Kohn Rysekchi he completed new routes on Asgard and Friga Barker despatched the route solo Slovenians added another of the big nail ups to their tally when Boris Lorencic and Armand Polegek climbed Aurora VI A in six days after fixing the first four pitches Eric Kohl who has established over big wall routes in the Park most of them solo added another to the nearby Falls Wall but details are unknown There were again many notable speed ascents of routes on the walls The prolific team of Dave Bengston Steve Gerberding and Scott Stowe were as usual well motivated They began with the first ever continuous ascent of Iron Hawk VI A in hours and minutes Their next project was a continuous ascent of Lost in America VI A which they despatched in a very rapid hours and minutes The same three also set a speed record for Lunar Eclipse completing this line in hours minutes Bengston and Stowe then teamed up with Conrad Anker for a record hours and two minutes ascent of Mirage VI A while Anker this time with Hans Florine and Mark Melvin reduced the record time for an ascent of the North America Wall to under hours completing this VI A route in just hours and minutes Florine and young Chris McNamara stomped up the Muir Wall VI A in a record hours and minutes Two important solo record ascents were achieved in Argentinian born Damien Benegas made an ascent of the classic Zenyatta Mondatta VI A in an unrelenting hours and minutes while Kevin Thaw took only hours and eight minutes to overcome the often wide cracks of the equally classic West Buttress VI A Benegas has now climbed El Cap wall routes on more than occasions a total of ascents possibly only beaten by the prolific Steve Gerberding who has now climbed the captain on well over occasions Having warmed up by climbing the Regular Route on Half Dome see below and making an ascent of Zodiac American resident Abby Watkins and fellow Australian Vera Wong beat Nancy Feagin and Sue McDevitt s all female record for The Nose lowering the time to hours and minutes The pair began the route at am on the th September and had to climb over and around six other parties before reaching the top Finally also marked the third all free ascent of the Salath eacute This time it was the turn of Thomas Huber brother to Alex who made the well publicized second ascent Thomas led all the pitches including the th a and the two b pitches on the headwall Half Dome In July Peter Coward and the well known Valley speed climber Hans Florine achieved the remarkable feat of linking the Regular and Direct Routes on the North West Face in a single day The Direct was climbed in a record hours and the Regular in three hours and minutes This inspired various other fast ascents on the wall and in mid August Coward and Florine returned driving from San Francisco climbing the Regular Route in just one minute over three hours and driving back in under hours The all women s record for this route was also beaten last year when the Australians Abby Watkins and Vera Wong climbed the route in just nine hours and minutes Wong and Willy Benegas also reportedly completed the Direct Route in hours and minutes The last word however came on Friday the th of September when the well known Slovenian Silvo Karo teamed up with Aischan Rupp making his second short trip to the Valley last year to climb the Direct in probably a new record time of hours and minutes The pair felt that this time could easily be improved as conditions for the ascent were far from ideal Halfway up the route it started to rain and this turned to snow near the top INFO Dave Pegg Aischan Rupp Kevin Thaw North American Ice Colorado In parallel to the tremendous activity in Europe this winter which successfully appears to have raised the technical standards of the new wave mixed climbing reported in the next issue America has also seen its share of impressive performances in and there is now a definite trend towards working and redpointing short difficult mixed problems The big breakthrough of the season was Will Gadd s route Amphibian a two pitch bolt protected line in the near vicinity of Octopussy at the laboratory of Vail After considerable time and effort bolting the route from above Gadd worked on the line for three weeks before making a clean lead of every section The route is a little over m long with the top overhanging the base by around m It has two pitches the first of which Gadd a noted Canadian sport climber redpointed at the beginning of March and the second somewhat harder pitch a week or so later However he was apparently unable climb the entire route in one complete ascent A rating of M or even M placed it in a new league of mixed climbing and made it a full grade harder than test pieces such as Octopussy The first pitch which is around m in length and graded climbs an overhanging rock wall on which there is absolutely no ice whatsoever The second involves a start on ice followed by two horizontal roofs of about m each and separated by an icicle at the top of which it is possible to get a good rest then more ice above the roofs to reach the top Quickly on the scene was Stevie Haston This was Haston s second visit to the USA to climb ice during the winter the first involving attendance at the ESPN ice climbing competition set up by Jeff Lowe and the Ouray Ice Festival Haston has spent almost six months this winter concentrating solely on his ice mixed climbing on average three and sometimes five days a week This appears to have paid off with a remarkable series of new routes details of which will appear in the next issue when we review the European Alpine winter On his first visit in January February he repeated Jeff Lowe s hard mixed route of Resurrection This is a typical Vail climb overcoming seriously impending rock to reach a free hanging icicle Lowe placed protection no bolts on aid then worked the route like a sport climb He felt it had a longer series of moves than Octopussy in its original condition but was about the same order of technical difficulty He rated it M Haston flashed it finding it an excellent though complex mixed climb and felt it to be Over in the Ice Park of Ouray Haston climbed a scary which in some ways he felt was the hardest thing he did all winter The route took a slender tapering hanging icicle that was only possible to climb by hooking and hugging It was top roped first as it was initially thought too fragile for a complete ascent The Box Canyon at Ouray was home to around climbers and an equal number of spectators for the Festival As reported in a previous INFO pure ice climbs are artificially created here using sprinkler valves on a large waterpipe that runs around the rim Though most climbs are top roped the routes still make very fine leads These half or one pitch climbs can be changed at will well in about three days to a week and the atmosphere is very friendly with the town encouraging climbing and giving discounts to visiting climbers Many of these visitors are now performing at a very high standard reaching grade after just a few weekends Notable routes are Bloody Sunday by Mark Wilford and a second route at the same grade by Will Gadd and his usual partner on the ice the prolific resident climber from Iceland Helgi Christensen Haston s second visit to the USA appears to have been even more productive Now at his strongest ever he first repeated Pete Takeda s recent route Fat Man and Robin originally worked over several days The route involves a three metre overhang and was graded by the first ascensionists Haston came close to flashing it and on his subsequent ascent felt that in reality it was probably only Fat Man and Robin is another line in the immediate vicinity of The Fang and Octopussy at Vail starting with the usual section of overhanging rock leading to a stalactite with the crux roof at the top Amphibian took him two days On the first session Haston had to resort to rest points on the top pitch but completed it clean on the second day The first pitch was thought to be rather than The initial roof on the second pitch he found to be quite juggy and he did it without ice tools or gloves where possible this does less damage to the rock and Gadd had taken a fall here when an axe placement broke The second he climbed at Haston s feeling is that the leading American climbers are making very real but smaller progress than was first thought and the top grade is being expanded somewhat disproportionately He also feels that his new routes Welcome to the Machine and in Italy s Val Savaranche now possibly the first genuine M s in the world have harder and more powerful moves and equally more demanding and fragile ice though are not as long as the routes at Vail Before leaving the USA Haston turned his overworked arms to the desert sandstone and became the first person to climb one of the main Fisher Towers without aid when he spent three days cleaning working and then free climbing Echo Tower by the line of Phantom Spirit The hard mixed routes being put up in Europe at present of which Trait de Lune a m high unconfirmed M in the eastern region of Switzerland s Jura mountains by the well known German Alpinist Robert Jasper is another ex le need cr ons to both start and finish the climbing Jasper s route includes an impressive bulge climbed free with bare hands cr ons and the somewhat limiting effect of full winter clothing and still thought to be around F a b Amphibian in contrast has a first pitch that is entirely on rock It may now be time to re assess what proportion of pure un iced rock should exist on a route in order for it to still be considered a mixed climb even by American standards The potential for climbing long rock walls to reach small hanging icicles is still vast and dry tooling is all the rage Certain climbers had suggested taking their axes and cr ons to the sport cliff of Rifle until they were made to realize the damage such an act would do to existing rock climbs Newcomer Gary Ryan also felt he had made a breakthrough by climbing Blade Runner at the popular Loch Vale area in Rocky Mountain National Park This route ascends m of overhanging granite to reach a thin ice curtain leading m to the top and is situated very close to several other recently created mixed routes Ryan brother of the British rock climber Tony Ryan and now an American resident placed three bolts plus four pegs then began working Blade Runner in late February On one of his attempts he had almost reached the top and was pulling on a small tree root when it snapped resulting in a spectacular fall Ryan finally redpointed the route on the th March giving it a rating of M Subsequent appraisal by certain other climbers and a flashed second ascent by Will Gadd confirmed that the standard was no more than M Ryan s subsequent failure to climb Resurrection seems to bear this out However Ryan a very strong climber undoubtedly did make a meteoric impact on the climbing world taking to the ice for the first time after years of rock climbing He quickly on sighted Secret Probation M at Vail and then went on to make only the second on sight ascent of Octopussy Other routes include a repeat of David Sheldon s Free Strike Zone M and a new route at Ouray Easter Rising which he gave a grade of M though this again is now widely believed to be somewhat over rated With the potential at Vail drying up other venues are now being examined At Glenwood Canyon Gadd and Jeff Lowe climbed Deep Throat a five star that apart from a few metres of rock in its m length is entirely on ice Another M has also been reported this time in the Cascade Canyon region of the state where Big Wall climber Jared Ogden and partner climbed Against the Grain The route actually followed the line of a hard but yet to be redpointed F b bolted rock climbing project negotiating a roof to reach ice above There have been attempts recently to equate ice to rock grades in order to try to answer the question as to what level mixed climbing is at relative to rock Gadd felt that Amphibian felt equivalent to a sport climb Although it is obviously impossible to make a direct comparison the following consensus at present gives a very rough indication of the physical difficulty involved with making an ascent of a short hard but well protected route such as those found at Vail M or F b or well protected E M or b to a or well protected E M or a to b M to or c to a M a to b INFO Stevie Haston Gary Ryan

Rock Climbing Greg Streatfield Crime at Waterval Boven Gustav van Rensburg Spitzkoppe Alard H uuml fner MCSA BMC Mozambique Expedition Alard H uuml fner The Shield Rope Soloed Alard H uuml fner The Nose in a Day Alard H uuml fner Rock Rally The view from a competitor By Galeo Saintz Oct There is just something about Boven the vista from the c site the easy access to climbs and the pure vibe of the place surely make it South Africa s premier sport climbing destination coupled with a good density of climbs and unlimited further potential it is the ideal place to hold a climbing festival Our group of young climbers arrived a couple of days before the event to warm up check out the crags and get familiar again with our favorite climbs Having spent many weekends at Boven over the years and having noticed in the last while a distinct reduction in the number of climbers pitching at crags and c site it was a welcome surprise to have the old vibe back loads of climbers from the experienced to the beginner The festival kicked off on the Friday evening Already by the afternoon though people were pulling in from everywhere Cape Town Nelspruit Pretoria even Natal Slack lines were strung hammocks stretched between trees and familiar faces reaffirmed the uniqueness and magic of climbing friendships Friday evening got going with a slide show on the remarkable rock art of the region presented by Conraad de Roser of Bongani Lodge on the border of Kruger National Park This slide show reminded all present that rock climbers were not the first to visit some of these awesome crags but that the bushmen were here long before us their many rock paintings at the base of some of Boven s most famous climbs are testament to the spiritual potency of the place For all we know some of their images on the rock may well be route descriptions we have overlooked just imagine Eraserhead may have been climbed for the first time some years ago and not in the closing decades of the th century Conraad s presentation certainly put things into perspective and reminded us that some of the places we climb are sacred sites to ancient people and as such hold significant ritual history just something to be aware of the next time we stand at the base of a climb and put our shoes on a slowly vanishing piece of our cultural heritage In good spirit the evening rounded off with a drumming circle around a mighty fire Drumming out a rhythm on a Yembe is one way of getting a good flow of blood to the chalky digits I have to attribute the quick healing of my raw fingertips to this primal form of communal expression It was good fun Saturday morning was slow climbers emerging from countless scattered tents and chalets the smell of coffee drifting from one group to another The rally was only scheduled to start at AM so all and sundry were taking it easy devising our strategy and selecting the routes most likely to score the most points based on the handicap system chosen This was calculated by adding the following The total of best red point ever best on sight ever best red point in last months best on sight in last months divided by to give an average grade If you climbed this grade during the rally you scored points any routes climbed above or below your handicap grade subtract or add points for each grade Each route then had a number of bonus points allocated depending on the grade of the route and the travelling distance to reach it Flashing the route scored an extra bonus points By Midday the teams were off groups of two s running in every direction The climbing was unbelievable thanks to the weather the Due to the scoring method the most effective way to really accumulate a good number of points was to climb as many easy routes as fast as possible at as many different crags as possible No easy feat The advantage for me of course was that I had the opportunity to get onto a vast amount of routes below grade that I had simply never considered climbing before And myself being a climber who prefers on sighting to red pointing I found great satisfaction in this At each of the crags there was great competitive spirit and immense camaraderie I can t remember the last time I climbed at The Coven where almost every climb had someone on it Of course the area has experienced a certain amount crime in the past but the tourism monitors were out in force keeping an eye out for any undesirable company yet keeping a good distance from the climbing itself allowing one to feel safe and yet not intruded upon There is also certain satisfaction knowing that climbing through this programme is creating employment of some kind and that the more people from different communities who come together to realise the value of climbing as a sport the better for all involved Although we thought we had a strategy that rocked my partner and I by the middle of the first day realised we had way over shot our ability to complete the number of routes chosen you know you have been pushing yourself when you start falling off routes two grades below your handicap because your forearms are cr ing Oh the sorrow when you know you are on a climb yet it feels like a Nothing compared though to the exhilaration of pushing through and reaching the top anchors One more route in the bag time to crash back across winding paths up hill down hill rushing to beat the cut off time points were deducted for each minute you arrived late Saturday night saw the festival really kick off loads of braaing everywhere another slide show this time on climbing and then live music Pity the main music event was scheduled for the Saturday evening everyone was so trashed and needing to recover for the second half of the rally the following day that any party was almost too much But hey all the hard core guys managed to pack it in After all this entire event is about endurance Sunday saw an early start by am we were hitting the crags again The sun was already blazing today we needed more water than chalk more sun block than cranking power Hallucinogen crag was packed whatever sequence of climbs we had planned was quickly tossed down into the valley today we would simply have to climb whatever we could get onto and instead of waiting for a climb simply run to the next closest available even if it was a grade for which we still scored bonus points and on sight points On returning to the finish by pm there was not a single face amongst all the climbers that wasn t a mixtureof sweat exhaustion and sheer happiness the kind that comes after spending a good day pushing your body to its limits scaling the most awesome rock in the country and being around good friends In my opinion this was a really successful rock rally and the prize giving said it all Climbing gear manufacturers and retailers really came to the party the sheer volume and quality of the prizes I think took everyone by surprise Although the winners walked away with new ropes and harnesses and a basket of other goodies valued at a small fortune it wasn t about what you could win but that all present had won a rally like this is about the spirit of climbing and what it means to just have a damn good time with a group of damn fine people Ed Feb certainly the most indomitable personality on the SA climbing scene walked away with the prize for the greatest winger and took it hands down Good on you Ed your presence adds humour and gets things moving Clinton Martinengo walked off with best on sights two s and a The highest number of points went to the local guys the big wall endurance team of Mark Seuring and Alard Hufner not only did they climb an impressive number of routes but also managed to visit over different crags no mean achievement that let me tell you all those long walk ins to remote big walls certainly seemed to pay off for this team To me the overall winner was no team in particular The real winner of this event was sport climbing in Boven To the team that pulled it all together thanks to you and all the climbers there was not a single accident or mishap the c site wasn t trashed and there was no crime Thanks for putting Boven on the map as a climbing festival destination and thanks for the most enjoyable weekend I have had in a long time To those that didn t make it make it next time because it is a rally like this that makes you feel proud of being a climber it is a rally like this that helps grow the sport and foster new friendships it is a rally like this that reminds you why you started sport climbing in the first place to be with great friends in an awesome location with some of the finest rock around just a little reminder of how fortunate we are to live and climb in Africa GATEWAY SPEED HEIGHT RECORDS By Garth Hattingh Sep Durbanites set three new world speed and distance climbing records between pm Friday th and pm Saturday th on The Rock Climbing Wall in Gateway Theatre of Shopping at meters the highest permanent indoor climbing wall in the world In this event the climber s had to climb The Rock on a top roped belay to get their feet above a designated meter mark then lower off to ground and repeat this obviously hundreds of times The teams not only climbed but also belayed one another The solo climber was allowed to use other climbers to belay him One team of four climbers The Degree Adventure Team set up a new hour record height of m eleven thousand one hundred and eleven meters climbing in turn virtually without rest This involved climbing times up and down The Rock some times each The average time per cimb was under two minutes The team consisted of Erin Adams Trent Burnett Dave Drummond and Benjamin Herr Another team The Rock Team went for the Sea Level to Top of Everest record a height of m They accomplished this in hours and minutes each member climbing over times at an average of well under two minutes per climb up and down The team consisted of Dale Boucher Willem Fourie Nic Geere and Matthew Gibbon A solo climber Mark Kojetin climbed m in the hours the height from Everest Base C to Summit thereby setting up another record These performances can comfortably be equated to extreme heights of endeavour in any other endurance sport or activity It is almost certain that these strictly monitored and noteworthy efforts will all find their rightful place in the Guinness World Record Book The challenge is there folks any contenders AROUSAL ANXIETY IN ROCK CLIMBING By Greg Streatfield Rock climbing is an inherently dangerous sport Therefore the sport is naturally a conducive to the experience of arousal and anxiety in its participants Arousal and anxiety are concepts often used interchangeably However in many instances they mean entirely different things Weinberg and Gould define arousal as the degree of activation of the organs and mechanisms that are under control of the body s autonomic nervous system Anxiety in its simplest form can be defined as the subjective feeling of apprehension and heightened arousal Weinberg Gould From personal experience I have often wondered why some days I can get totally gripped climbing on an easy sport route yet on other days I can lead a hard trad route and feel no anxiety at all even though the danger of injury is far greater I am sure many of you out there have had exactly the same experiences A psychological model known as Reversal theory may be able to explain these experiences Reversal Theory has been used to explain many kinds of non rational behaviour including soccer hooliganism The basic idea of Reversal Theory is that there are a number of separate and identifiable ways in which we all experience the world As we pass through our everyday lives we move between these different experiential states We are all as it were different people at different times These states known in Reversal Theory as metamotivational states have three related characteristics They originate from a basic psychological desire or value They are each associated with their own range of emotions and They each involve seeing the world in their own way Reversal Theory maintains that each of these metamotivational states is found in pairs of opposites Therefore change consists of movement between members of each pair with only one of them functioning at a time These switches between pairs are called reversals Although situations and events play a part in determining a person s metamotivational state at any given time psychological aspects within the person are also relevant The effect of this is that a person can be in the same situation at different times yet experience it differently therefore behaving differently as well Four pairs of metamotivational states are found These are the telic paratelic negativistic conformist mastery sympathy and autic alloic Kerr The telic paratelic and negativistic conformist form the somatic emotions and the transactional emotions are formed by the combination of autic alloic and mastery sympathy The somatic emotions are important in the way in which individuals experience arousal Kerr The transactional emotions are as a result of an individual s experience of the degree to which he or she has lost or gained in an interaction Kerr The telic paratelic metamotivational states pair is the most important in explaining the experiences of arousal and anxiety in rock climbing refer to Figure The telic state is a serious minded state in which the individual sees himself or herself as engaged in some purposeful activity which is important beyond itself The paratelic state is a playful state in which the ongoing activity is engaged in for its own sake for the immediate enjoyment which it can provide The basic desire in the telic state is for some significant achievement while in the paratelic state the desire is to have fun with immediate gratification Each state has a different range of emotions In the telic state there is a range from relaxation to anxiety and in the paratelic state from boredom to excitement In the telic state a person becomes anxious as arousal levels increase but feels relaxed under low levels of arousal In the paratelic state a person becomes more pleasantly excited as arousal levels increase but bored if there is a lack of stimulation So how does explain the experiences I referred to earlier People who rock climb are expected to be dominant in the paratelic metamotivational state During rock climbing it is anticipated that there is a switch to the paratelic state which is better equipped to deal with the type of arousal experienced The high arousal of a hard trad lead climb will be experienced as pleasant excitement However in the gripped scenario on an easy sport route due to internal psychological circumstances the paratelic state has not been switched to and therefore the experience of anxiety occurs Simple So is it possible to switch metamotivational states At this stage this is difficult to determine Research suggests that metamotivational states can be switched using mental imagery However at this stage the studies have not shown conclusive results and you probably just need to let psychology run it course and the switch will naturally occur References Apter M Reversal theory What is it On line Available http www swin edu au ssb rt bpapter htm

here have been isolated and few and far between Even the dreaded Waterfall Gorge area has been frequented a lot lately despite its obvious closeness to the township Since BMW launched their new series here at the tunnel and a bunch of money was donated to sponsor tourism development projects crime has cooled down and tourists are now accompanied by guides and a guards look after cars at the tunnel waterfall and bridge attractions Now it seems as if those criminals are looking further into the hills to find their loot Three incidents took place this weekend one on Saturday at the Coven and two on Monday at Hallucinogen Wall We were all just as shocked as you are to hear that they have not only made it all the way out there to Wonderland on foot to mug climbers at knifepoint but also trespassed MCSA property in doing so I received a call around h on Monday and immediately sent out five local guys also from Emgwenya the local township to help us track these guys down in vein Thanks to the police all the other climbers that waited while I was supposed to pick you up and the guys that helped looking out for the poor dudes that is now financially better of than their mates more about that later In a meeting later Monday evening with some of the guys that got ripped off and my friends from the township we came up with a bunch of facts that all climbers should take note of These incidents could have been easily prevented if the climbers reported the young locals very neatly dressed and well spoken as suspicious characters I am not pointing fingers here the climbers admitted to have been to relaxed thinking that these locals looked as if they could have been from a school climbing club The result of these incidents is that climbers would unfortunately have to take a bit more care when going to crags in future The amounts of cash cell phones etc that is now in the hands of the criminals will be encouraging them keep on going So Do not take valuables to the crags there is a safe at Roc n Rope for wallets etc Hide your cell phone under a bush and switch it off so that you can call someone in a medical emergency etc Try to go in groups and take a big Jarvis like character and or your viscous attack dog along Immediately report wanderers lurking or without packs to the police on or to us on The police inspectors have been very helpful and have in the past recovered a bunch of stolen stuff Do no underestimate these guys They respond quickly and rely on you to get detailed information to them as soon as possible Some of the local guys that climb and work with us Thulani in this case have redpointed up to grade opened routes and are just as determined to get to the bottom of our problem They know that crime will make people not visit the area and THEY WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS So in effect we have much more locals on our side than the couple of cowards running around with their little knives taking chances on the contents of your pack It is a small community and generally very friendly and honest Just a couple of desperate and criminal minds amongst them The police officers ask that all cases be reported immediately Officially they suggest that no resistance should be offered and one should hand over anything they ask for Unofficially uhmmm well yes no If you call from a cell ask for Waterval BOVEN police station sometimes calls can go to Waterval station in the Northern Province Try your best to identify suspects as far as scars and facial features speech impediments jewellery clothing etc Visually follow the direction they flee in if you can get to an elevated spot Call us at Roc n Rope We work with the police and will send informers to try and identify suspects For now we are desperately working on plans to make sure that our guides are also climbing at the crags when you are there They will be marked with Roc n Rope Adventure shirts or jackets Also I know I will not be harassed while my dog Ceaser or the local dog from the Shamrock Arms Julius is with me The rental fees include biscuits biltong water Lastly the climbing and weather here is too good to let this take the better of us If we all work together for a while and take precaution justice will sort these guys out and we will have all crags back again PS We will carry stock of pepper spray ninja knives hand grenades and bazookas very soon SPITZKOPPE By Alard H uuml fner Mark Seuring Steve Broccardo and myself spent a week in Namibia weeks ago we were climbing at Spitzkoppe we opened a new pitch route to the right of INXS and to the right of the SW route just to the left of Watersports and parallel to it the next crack corner up our route named Everything in Moderation is graded at five of the pitches are bolted and the rest of the route follows a perfect layback hand jamming crack with bomber gear the grade pitch is a very wide flaring horizontal crack it is about meters long and bolted VERY strenuous The top pitches are good quality face climbing a star route Superb We also onsighted the standard route to the summit in hiking boots and without the use of ropes gear or harnesses makes for an interesting descent MCSA BMC MOZAMBIQUE EXPIDITION By Alard H uuml fner We just got back from the joint MCSA BMC expedition to northern Mozambique We were successful in climbing our objective Sitting Chief local name Murupie We had quite an adventure getting there of us in cars One car a double cab Toyota Hilux and the other a old Land Rover Forward Control Any way this Landrover is like an Unimog it is BIG and slow but has loads of character and is strong On the way up just before the Zimbabwe border the head gasket of the Hilux blew so of us and all our bigwall gear and equipment squashed into the Landrover for a very slow drive through Zimbabwe Tete corridor Malawi and then into Mozambique days of travelling we finally arrived at Lalaua the village near Sitting Chief About a hour later and to everyone s amazement Pieter arrived in the Hilux He had stayed behind in Masina to get the head gasket fixed and then drove km on his own to catch up with us The Administrator in Lalaua would not give us permission to climb the dome as the area contained valuable minerals according to a Dutch company who had done a survey and now no one was allow to enter the area around the dome So we drove hours on bad roads to the capital city of the north N ula to speak to the Governor who then gave us permission to climb The climbing looked like it would be interesting from a distance as the face contained huge huecos big holes in the rock shallow caves We split up into climbing parties to attempt different lines It turned out that a couple of pitches up the rock became covered in thick lichen which made for unpleasant climbing The attempts were aborted at various levels up the rockface Next we focused our energies on reaching the summit via a huge corner system this provided for some interesting climbing up corners and chimneys at about grade Peter Robins Dave Turnbull and Pieter Martin were first on the summit followed by Leo Holding Mark Seuring and Alard H uuml fner Ben Bransby and Andrew Donson got within one pitch of the summit the day before but turned back as it was getting late Matthew Munting and Izak Steyn retreated off their route We then headed off to Mlema to do some real climbing on African Light the route that Mark and I opened in BUT it rained Rain in the middle of winter Dave Ben and Andy spent a miserable night bivying in the rain at the base of the climb They had planned to bivi on Bundu ledge but the rain caught them pitches up and it was getting dark so they abseiled down and sat out the night in the rain with spirits d ened and the weather looking grim we headed off to lake Malawi Here we relaxed in the sun and did some kayaking with Kayak Africa A further days of travelling by now we were so accustomed to this we arrived at Blyde River Canyon where we opened some amazing climbs This was definitely the climbing highlight of the trip A couple of climbs at were opened onsight Two days at the Restaurant clipping bolts and it was time for the Brits to leave South Africa We all had a great time and got on very well Our slack lining has drastically improved A huge THANK YOU to the Mountain Club of South Africa Upat Fuji film Scavenger Rock on climbing and WorldExpedition org for assisting the expedition through sponsorship THE SHIELD ROPE SOLOED BY ALARD HUFNER By Alard H uuml fner November My Friends and I were sitting in the Yosemite meadows looking up at climbers on El Cap when we spotted someone on this blank headwall That had to be the Shield it looked so exposed We were amazed that a climb even went up this piece of rock During the next couple of weeks I spoke to people who had done the route and they all said that it was a real fun route with lots of open space and exposure When Mike Marianne and Dermot had left the Valley I needed something to climb and so the idea to solo the Shield popped into my head I had never soloed a big wall before and only practiced rope soloing on two other occasions When I was learning to rope solo I had rope soloed the first ten pitches to Mammoth Ledges same first ten pitches as Free Blast and Salethe from where there are fixed lines all the way down to the ground When I was ready for the route I jugged up those lines with all my requirements for days I managed two pitches higher than the fixed ropes and as it was getting dark I set up the porta ledge and was comfy asleep when it started raining So in the dark and rain I had to re setup the porta ledge with the fly which was brand new and had not been seam sealed It kept raining until about in the morning The wind was blowing the whole ledge around I was not far from this little gully which the rain turned into a river This all made for an unpleasant adventure Most of the things got fairly wet during the night and as I had lost my enthusiasm to continue retreat was still possible as I was not to high so I fixed some lines and abseiled all the way down to the ground leaving the gear at my high point Spent the weekend re motivating in San Francisco and had loads of fun as it was Halloween Monday I jugged back up the lines climbed some more pitches and set up the ledge below a big roof There were three American climbers on a route called Albatross which runs parallel to the Shield and only about thirty to forty meters to the left Therefore I had some company as we shouted across to each other every now and then In the morning I lead the roof pitch which brought me straight onto the headwall The exposure started to kick in in a big way The Shield headwall starts about m up is blank slightly bulging slightly overhanging and smooth except for a thin crack seam running up it In many places copper heads and rurps baby pitons are the only things that will fit There were a lot of fixed copper heads so I did not have to place any which was good because I only had two copperheads anyway I did not clip the copperheads because in the event of a fall they would probably be ripped out and I would be unable to put in more This caused me to lead out several times This was the case when I was nearing the bolts but I could just not reach them There was some sling tape around the bolt so I clipped my aiders into that and stood in them I was about to clip into the bolt direct when I heard this frightening tear and the next sensation was falling through the air upside down It was amazing how fast I thought about the last placement I had clipped if it would hold how far was I going to fall Thank goodness this old fixed aluminum piton held and I came to an upside down halt about eight meters lower than I was a few seconds earlier Thank goodness this rope soloing technique works I managed to get back up to the bolts making sure I clipped the bolts this time and then set up c To the left and right and up and down there was just blank rock with only this three or four millimeter wide crack seam leading the way Three pitches a day is about the going rate for A or harder when soloing and that s what I was managing on the headwall Going to the toilet can be an interesting affair The rules are climbers must carry a porta potty So one has to do one s business into a brown paper bag and then put this into the porta potty which can be a bucket with a lid or a large PVC pipe with lids Aiming into the paper bag is vital when on a porta ledge as soiling the ledge would not be fun as this is the kitchen the bed and the bathroom I managed to take another two falls higher up on the head wall when gear popped The one fall was about ten meters and as I was falling it was ripping out lots of the gear I had placed When I finally came to a halt all the popped gear slid down the rope towards me in this instance about pieces of gear I then went back up hammering in those pitons which I had been slightly reluctant to do as getting pitons out is more work Above the head wall ledges start appearing which makes biving sleeping much easier The penultimate pitch is a big fun roof and the last pitch a chimney The only problem I had was on the last haul when I was hauling the last two pitches in one The fifi hook would not release from the bolt so I had to abseil back down over the roof hanging in mid air a m up then pull myself back into the stance to release the bag and then jumar back up A couple of meters of grade four scrambling and I was at the TOP time for a beer Ahhhh after seven days climbing it felt great to be at the top The hike down was absolutely terrible having to carry all that equipment The route was opened in The speed record for the Shield from bottom to top is an incredible ten hours fifty eight minutes Two days later I left the valley for the last time on this trip as rain and the first snow fell Extreme Thanks go to Hans Florine Abby Watkins Dan Dunkal Craig Calonica and Dan Mc Divett who let me use and abuse their gear THE NOSE IN A DAY By Alard H uuml fner Every time I look up at El Cap in Yosemite Valley I think to myself that is one huge piece of rock Marianne Pretorius and I climbed the Nose together in August It took us four days Mike Mason and Dermot Brogan started ahead of us and it took them days When one is on a big wall for four days one has to haul a lot of items up water food sleeping bags etc and thus the haul bag can weigh over kg This slows one s climbing down considerably because the haulbag needs to get pulled up at every stance When Hans said to me that he had a free day to go climbing I hinted that I was keen to climb the Nose and thus we made plans to climb it in a day As Hans had climbed the route times before he holds the record for most Nose ascents he knew the exact rack of gear needed The rack consisted of double caming devices from to two inch and one each of three and four inch A couple of quick draws and six nuts were taken mainly micro nuts One m rope two ascenders and some aiders liters of water some Power bars and peanuts We awoke at h am had breakfast and set off We started the climb at h am As I did not enjoy the first couple of pitches on my earlier ascent Hans led to Sickle Ledge I took the lead from there and led up the Stovelegs these pitches were named by Warren Harding who opened the route in when he used pitons made from the legs of an old stove as protection Hans simul climbed below me We passed one party of two climbers who happily let us by Hans lead the last pitch up to Dolt Tower with me jugging on the line he fixed It is quicker if the leader gets to a stance fixes the rope and the seconder juggs up and cleans the pitch We reached Dolt Tower in just over two hours which on the previous trip had taken us days I led on towards El Cap Tower As I had been up the Texas Flake and the Bootleg Flake with Marianne we decided on doing the Jardine Traverse a slight variation to the route Three more pitches and we were at c four the half way mark on the route We sat for a couple of minutes ate some food drank some water and enjoyed the amazing view it was so cool Hans led the pitch up to the Great Roof then I led the Great Roof which took me minutes to lead and minutes for Hans to clean it thus taking min for that pitch I was leading using Hans super light aiders and whilst stepping up on a piece of gear one of the straps on the aiders snapped letting me drop about cm before it caught me again thus sending some adrenaline through my system This pitch has only been free climbed by Lynn Hill and Scott Burke IT LOOKS AMAZINGLY SUPER DIFFICULT I free climbed the next pitch called the Pancake Flake which has its name due to it being a thin flake that forms a super lay back Free climbing this pitch at about grade is super because one is about m up and there is great exposure We alternated leads most of the way to the top passing a team of four Italians on the second last last pitch We reached the top nine hours and twenty two minutes after we had started Brilliant This was my third time up El Cap and Hans sixty sixth time The walk down took hour and minutes It felt very good just to be able to sit in the car This is a super route with excellent cracks in clean solid granite Highly recommended I was very fortunate to be able to climb this

'NSR of Western Canada The Ben Albert Memorial Award How a carefully planned adventure to the B C backcountry became a tragedy that swept seven teens to their deaths It s a soft gray morning The ground is blanketed by eight centimeters of fresh snow The temperature hovers around zero The past hours have been avalanche free and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountry skiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass in eastern British Columbia They are not alone The mountain guides spot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popular Balu Pass Husband and wife pause to say hello It s a beautiful day out here isn t it says Abby Yes someone responds They leave the teenagers and three adults behind climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treed area Abby looks back at the people below and a gangly teen all arms and legs catches her eye Aren t kids funny Look at that kid she tells Rich At that very moment just before noon on Saturday something gives way on the rugged north face of Cheops Mountain Abby and Rich hear a thunderous roar They watch in horror as a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley picking up speed and debris The school group is directly in its path Rich screams Avalanche Avalanche Avalanche The skiers look up Ben Albert is frantically trying to cram his day pack into a big black backpack already bulging with clothes equipment and enough food for a breakfast and stir fry dinner for himself and three other hungry year olds He finally wedges it in and staggers out the door It s early Friday morning His mother Carol Neale watches uneasily as he and her husband Gerald pull out onto the road and head to the Canadian Tire parking lot on the western edge of Calgary There Ben will rendezvous with other Grade students from the elite Strathcona Tweedsmuir private school for a long weekend of backcountry telemark skiing a difficult activity that combines cross country and downhill The trip is the culmination of two months of intense training and the most arduous yet of the school s celebrated year long outdoor education program Despite the early hour the excitement among the boys and three girls is infectious Michael Shaw is so keyed up he talked the night away with his younger sister Kathryn She tried to get him to go to bed but he just kept talking They are close these healthy strong accomplished year olds Many have grown up together Michael and his best pal Taylor Carcasole are there in one of two vans that will take everyone to Rogers Pass The two are inseparable Teachers know them as mischief Taylor is the mis and Michael the chief Ben Albert sees Scott Broshko and Jeff Trickett They are three parts of a group of four talented teens known as the Fearsome Foursome Scott has been talking about the expedition almost nonstop since training began Outdoor trips are his passion For his birthday he asked for a sleeping bag The night before Daniel Arato bombarded his older brother Thomas with excited questions about what to take His father had left a day earlier for his own ski trip The two exchanged kisses and hugs Mr Arato told his son to keep his head in the game and do what he s told As the two parted Daniel told his dad I love you The leader of the expedition is teacher Andrew Nicholson a skilled and experienced skier well trained in avalanche awareness He is so demanding in checking snow conditions that previous groups have dubbed him Nazi Nick Parents have signed waivers protecting the school in the event of deaths or injuries but Carol Neale is worried She can t stop thinking about an avalanche less than two weeks before that killed seven experienced backcountry skiers just kilometers away from where Ben and his classmates are headed Scott Broshko s mother Donna knows about that avalanche too But she thinks What is the likelihood Just what is the likelihood of that She gives him a quick hug He ll be back on Monday It s a four hour journey to Glacier National Park The winding kilometre drive along the Trans Canada Highway west from Calgary offers some of the most stunning views in the country replete with neck craning mountain walls and stomach churning sheer drops to valleys below Along the way are warning signs for fallen rocks and avalanche debris Runaway lanes for truckers who lose their brakes on the steep inclines are common Even more ominous are five long avalanche tunnels protecting the highway from the walls of snow that regularly cut loose from the steep upper slopes surrounding Rogers Pass With an annual average snowfall of up to meters the area has one of the deadliest concentrations of avalanches in the world enough to keep an on site military unit stationed there equipped with explosives and howitzers to bring down threatening avalanches before they become dangerous The vans arrive at the park about noon and the STS expedition wastes no time heading for its weekend headquarters the A O Wheeler Hut an easy two kilometer trek from the highway The A frame log building complete with two wood stoves and propane systems for cooking and light is nestled in a cedar forest The cabin sleeps in three rooms The teenagers stow their large packs and after exacting tests of snow conditions by Mr Nicholson they start to ski exhilarated by liberation from school on a Friday afternoon and giddy with the fresh mountain air That evening exhausted from their wonderful afternoon the students are divided into groups Each prepares its own dinner Marissa Staddon and her group pig out on chocolate fondue Scott Broshko s dines on quesadillas much to the envy of another group grumpily making do with Hamburger Helper Through the night snoring from Scott and his pal Jeff Trickett keeps some of the boys in the same room from sleeping By the time they wake Saturday morning Parks Canada has already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountry skiers In tree line and alpine areas the avalanche risk has been assessed as considerable the mid range of the five possible ratings Below the tree line the risk is assessed as moderate with natural avalanches unlikely And the STS group intends to stay below the tree line throughout its telemark expedition to Balu Pass But the bulletin also refers to weak snow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failed to stabilize There were similar references for the same mountain range in avalanche bulletins last month just before the deadly slide that claimed seven lives near Revelstoke B C The group makes its way to the Rogers Pass information building a macaroni shaped structure with a sod and timber roof to pore over the latest information Mr Nicholson goes inside He asks about conditions in several areas before heading back to the students and two other adults a fellow teacher and a chaperone The group decides it is safe to ski that day By a m they are on the trailhead to the pass five kilometers away described by backcountry enthusiasts as an easy but beautiful trail They ski through forest along a rocky creek over a snow covered bridge and into the Connaught Creek valley Surrounded by mountains and deep powder snow the scenery is breathtaking Reminders of past avalanches are everywhere Relentless slides tearing down either side of the valley over the years have littered the area with rocks and stumps Foliage is sparse on the valley floor The school group successfully crosses four avalanche prone paths on the north side of the valley and three on the south side They note that the debris from one avalanche path across the valley is no more than a week old They are halfway to their destination The guide s frantic warning comes too late The avalanche hits them head on In a matter of seconds all skiers are swept away in a huge terrifying tangle of snow rocks and trees The swiftness and power of the avalanche sounds like a freight train moving at high speeds Abby thinks A huge roar The power of that much snow moving at the acceleration of gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way Nobody could have got out of the way Nobody Avalanche Spread The river rush of snow engulfs the skiers then separates them A section of the slide breaks away and keeps going carrying a number of victims hundreds of meters down the valley Disoriented and tumbling head over foot with little chance to swim to the surface this unlucky group ends up as much as meters beneath the concrete hard snow Up in the trees Abby and Rich are dusted by a thick cloud of powder A terrible silence falls over the valley Though their hearts are thumping they shut down their emotions On goes the search and rescue switch one they have trained for years to put into practice They race down to the first group of buried skiers The only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legs poking through the snow The others in the toe of the slide at the bottom of the valley are buried much deeper Alone at the scene the husband and wife team is faced with heartbreaking decisions Who to save first Not everybody would make it they reason But those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival Rich runs for the first hand he sees and begins digging It s Andrew Nicholson He finds Mr Nicholson s shovel so the group leader can dig himself out and moves on Mr Nicholson has a satellite phone and calls for help But for the next minutes except for the victims Rich and Abby are there by themselves working to free as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow The guides transceivers work perfectly honing in with beeps and flashing lights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons like shouts from the grave The couple follows the rules of avalanche rescue like clockwork Only dig to a victim to make sure he or she is breathing Clear snow from the victim s face No CPR before moving on to the next victim There are too many Let survivors dig themselves out Once free the numb and distraught living do their best to help Taylor Carcasole is frantic His best friend Michael Shaw is missing Where s Michael Where s Michael The victims are scattered beneath the snow Rich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible The first five people they pull out survive Those survivors go on to rescue others Everyone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead The grim lottery of who shall live and who shall die is over Seven students make it Seven do not An hour after the avalanche seven helicopters three dogs and more than individuals are on site By p m the final victim has been dug out One survivor with a broken ankle is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital The remaining survivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the park warden s station The bodies go too They are laid out on mats in a makeshift morgue in the same building Chuck Purse Revelstoke s part time coroner is investigating his second seven death avalanche within two weeks He examines each body in turn None show signs of major injury They were simply swept away and buried dying from asphyxiation The bodies are wrapped in blankets put in body bags and taken to the local Brandon Bowers Funeral Chapel Co owner Gary Sulz sends ordinary vans to collect the bodies because he thinks the sight of a fleet of hearses will upset the survivors Back in Calgary news of the tragedy begins rippling through the close knit community of parents by late afternoon Donna and Dave Broshko are just leaving for evening mass when Strathcona Tweedsmuir head Tony Macoun calls to tell them there s been an accident He says there are fatalities He doesn t say who has died Mrs Broshko immediately phones Ben Albert s mother Carol Neale Ben and Scott have been classmates since elementary school Carol have you heard There s been an accident What are you talking about No she screams I told him I didn t want him to go I didn t want him to go At the Arato home Peter skiing that weekend at Big White in Kelowna B C is talking to his wife when her cell phone rings A friend has heard news reports of a tragedy where their son Daniel was skiing Mr Arato soon learns from the radio that seven are dead from a school near Okotoks where his boy s school is He thinks the odds will not be in his favour The parents are told to go to the school Judith Arato makes the kilometre drive alone She calls Peter in hysterics Daniel is dead Mr Arato s friends charter a plane and send him home Carol Neale s worst fears are confirmed the moment she arrives at Strathcona Tweedsmuir As she steps inside the foyer another mother stops her I ve heard from my son she tells Ms Neale relief written all over her face I haven t heard from my son replies Ms Neale Minutes later Tony Macoun tells her why Ben is dead Mrs Broshko meanwhile is panic stricken a horrible sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach She can t stand not knowing She phones the RCMP in Revelstoke No luck She phones Glacier Park Lodge begging a clerk to go across the highway where the survivors are to see if her Scotty is alive Oh please please please go across the road for me I will be forever in your debt Tell me that my son is there The woman agrees She phones back No one will tell her anything Finally the anguished couple head for the school They are ushered in to see Mr Macoun It s such a tragedy he begins I don t want to hear about the tragedy Just tell me about Scott Mrs Broshko says Mr Macoun says I m very sorry Scott s gone That night Donna Broshko sleeps with a picture of Scott and her taken just before he went to the school s formal Christmas dance He is wearing his dad s suit and tie His father wore the same suit and tie at Scott s funeral on Thursday Skiers are soon back on the same Connaught Creek trail where last week s avalanche claimed its bright young victims They ask offhandedly about the morgue worried that the jagged debris may be tricky to cross Not far from the trailhead lies a wreath with two ski poles stuck upright in the snow Names of the dead year olds Jeff Trickett Scott Broshko Daniel Arato Ben Albert Marissa Staddon Michael Shaw and Alex Pattillo are listed on the wreath with the epigraph Your Youth Will Be Eternal Farther along the path one glimpses a more somber memorial the deadly toe of the avalanche At the bottom of the valley are three pits They are several meters deep a meter across and not far apart Three burial holes left behind and no one has filled them in Timetable of tragedy On Saturday Feb Grade students from Strathcona Tweedsmuir School south of Calgary set out on a backcountry ski trip up the Balu Pass in Glacier National Park B C At around a m they were caught in an avalanche that killed seven of them Here is the sequence of events on that day Before departing the leaders checked with the National Park staff for current avalanche conditions They were advised that the threat of avalanches was moderate below the tree line and considerable above it Students were equipped with personal avalanche beacons probes and shovels At a m students left A O Wheeler Hut by van and headed to Rogers Pass Information Center where they conducted at least one test for avalanche risk a m Commencement of trip up the Balu Pass trail Following standard procedure the one teacher led and the other adult leaders followed at the rear of the skiers who were metres from each other a m About halfway up the valley an avalanche slid off the ridge of Cheops Mountain burying the group Two skiers about meters ahead helped rescue the teacher in the lead who contacted wardens by satellite phone p m Six students were reported alive p m Wardens arrive p m All students were accounted for including the seven who lost their lives p m One of the students was tobogganed back to the motel with a broken ankle Meanwhile helicopters joined the rescue and airlifted students to the motel parking lot from where they were transported to a private home in Revelstoke How the avalanche happened A small slide began high up on the ridge of Cheops Mountain above the south side of Connaught Creek Valley This set off a huge second slide that crashed into the valley bottom with such force that it rode high up the opposite wall as it was redirected eastward down the valley burying the group of skiers Copyright All

Face Type Skiing Ski mountaineering Injured Fatalities Fatal avalanche path on Mt Cheops Feb Photo by Canadian Press RCMP Description Sunday February REVELSTOKE B C Seven teens on a high school ski excursion in the treacherous back country of east central B C died Saturday when a half kilometre wide avalanche roared down from a mountainside and engulfed their group It was the second deadly slide to hit the region in as many weeks Seven adults perished in a slide in January The dead were six boys and one girl all in Grade at Strathcona Tweedsmuir School a private day school on an expansive rural c us in the foothills southwest of Calgary The surviving students the two teachers and parent chaperone were expected back in Calgary late Sunday night Six of the students have some scrapes and bruises and one male suffered a broken ankle We are absolutely stricken with grief Our hearts go out to all those who are impacted Tony Macoun head of the school said in a written statement Frantic parents gathered at the school Saturday night arriving separately and in groups embracing each other No students were visible Our school is a small family and loss this extreme is impacting us tremendously said Macoun There were people in the school group three adults and Grade students in an outdoor education class on their annual cross country ski trip The avalanche occurred on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park just before noon said Pam Doyle superintendent for Parks Canada in Revelstoke It happened on the north face of the mountain in Connaught Creek Valley section of Balu Valley about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit The group was led by two male teachers and a male volunteer All had certification and back country experience Macoun said The group had been skiing about metres apart with one supervisor in front and the other two bringing up the rear The skiers were halfway up the valley when the avalanche roared down the north slope burying nearly the entire group Another group of young skiers witnessed the avalanche and were among the first to help A supervisor whose hand was just visible above the snow was the first to be dug out Once freed he called park wardens on a satellite phone to raise the alarm Of the remaining students six of the students are safe and one has a broken ankle Macoun said in his statement The three leaders were uninjured and are attending to the survivors who were in Revelstoke on Saturday night after being airlifted first to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter Two people from the group were treated for minor injuries said RCMP Sgt Randy Brown The avalanche was very powerful with a rating from to compared with a top rating of said Pat Dunn a Parks Canada spokeswoman The size to avalanche could destroy a building or acres of forest she said The slide was to metres wide and travelled a kilometre down the slope Some of the skiers were buried as deep as three metres said Dunn She said the group was carrying the proper avalanche rescue equipment including personal locator beacons and digging tools A park conditions bulletin said there was a considerable avalanche hazard in the area Saturday That rating is about the middle of the hazard scale but includes the high probability that a person could trigger a slide said Dunn The risk always varies when the risk is posted as considerable it s a note to skiers to be cautious she said There are a couple of instabilities in our snow pack this winter that may have contributed and further investigation will determine that Saturday s slide was unusually deadly said Eric Dafoe public safety officer with Parks Canada in Revelstoke We ve never had an avalanche like this where we had a multiple number of people buried said Dafoe who worked on the rescue effort and flew over the slide as part the initial investigation It was a huge slide he said It covered the valley floor from side to side Dafoe said the slide began at a point between to vertical metres up Mount Cheops It travelled for a kilometre and spread out half a kilometre at the sides The toe of the slide ended at about the metre elevation mark with parts of it more than five metres deep Dafoe said the investigation will continue but was almost certain it was a natural slide It the slide trigger site is so far from the bottom it seems unlikely it was human triggered he said Dafoe speculated a small slide may have occurred high up the mountain and as it came down it dragged out snow from surrounding gullies Park wardens RCMP officers and local ski tour operators and guides backed up by four or five helicopters and search dogs joined in the rescue effort Members of a Canadian Horse Artillery unit stationed in the park for avalanche control work were also on hand to assist It was the second major slide in the area in a month Seven people in a party of back country skiers died in a much smaller avalanche Jan on Durrand Glacier located about kilometres east of Saturday s slide A memorial service for the victims was held just Friday in a Revelstoke church Ruedi Beglinger owner of Selkirk Mountain Experience and organizer of the fatal expedition last month was with his clients when it struck Contacted Saturday night Beglinger did not want to comment on the level of experience necessary to ski the area where the students were caught There is an inherent risk in back country skiing which is very important to talk about an inherent risk people have to be willing to share amongst themselves whether they have a guide or not he said The area of Saturday s slide is not particularly remote but Dunn said there were no groomed trails except people who have been there before you But no guides are needed to ski in the area and skiers do not have to register before setting off It s a very very popular ski destination site said Dunn media liaison officer at the national park Brown said the skiers were not part of a commercial tour group Doyle said that at this time there are no plans yet to close back country areas of the park UPDATE REVELSTOKE B C CP Authorities said Sunday it was time to take another look at the safety of back country skiing in an area where a day earlier seven Calgary area teens were swept to their deaths in a massive avalanche Six boys and one girl were killed Saturday while skiing with a high school group on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit in east central British Columbia B C Premier Gordon C bell said Sunday he wanted his government to work with federal officials and professional associations on a comprehensive review of safety in such wilderness expanses Obviously all of us have to work together on this said C bell who did not specify the scope he thought a review should take or what role he thought the provincial government should assume None of us want this to happen to anyone who is enjoying our parks and our wilderness C bell offered few details on what changes might be proposed saying it was important to wait and get all the information that we need to make sure the steps we take are steps that will move us down the right road Meanwhile a Parks Canada official with the federal department s local avalanche control section said the current system for providing risk bulletins to back country skiers in the park would be re evaluated David Skjonsberg said the area where the teens died is under Parks Canada jurisdiction but the department doesn t carry out any avalanche control for back country areas of the park His office provides daily avalanche risk bulletins but there is an expectation that the user make their own decision in terms of destinations trip procedures and the type of equipment Skjonsberg said the avalanche warning system would be re evaluated but thought it was unlikely we re going to see any major changes in our approach We believe we re providing a good quality product for back country users he said But perhaps there s something we re missing in how we convey the information to users so they really fully understand our definition of the danger ratings for instance and what the potential consequences of that danger rating might be He was hesitant to say whether the group composed of students and three adult supervisors should have been skiing in the area at the time they were hit At any time if you travel in mountains there is always a risk he said The probability of an avalanche is never zero Clair Israelson director of the Canadian Avalanche Association in Revelstoke said Sunday it was time that B C and Alberta and Canada seriously address the avalanche safety issue in Western Canada He recommended that a coalition of industry government and private sector workers work together to promote better warning systems Skjonsberg said he didn t foresee the long term closure of the area where the avalanche occurred The area was reopened by Sunday night after being temporarily closed for investigators If I was to close that area I m afraid I d have to be looking at virtually closing off the back country of the park and I really don t feel that s warranted he said I think people can travel safely in the mountains The high school group was hit just before noon by a massive slide that swept through the Connaught Creek Valley on Mount Cheops The group included students and three adult supervisors The tragedy was only about kilometres away from the site of a smaller slide two weeks earlier that killed seven adult back country skiers That avalanche was termed a fluke of nature by one survivor and authorities said there was no evidence it was caused by the skiers themselves Saturday s slide travelled through the valley and into the shoulder where the party was climbing the valley said Eric Dafoe a public safety officer with Parks Canada in Revelstoke It was about metres wide and officials said it was capable of destroying a building Two nearby mountain guides witnessed the slide and had just managed to shout a warning when the slide hit Dafoe said the skiers had somewhere between four and five seconds before being swept away The two guides rushed over and managed to dig out a supervisor whose hand was just visible through the snow That supervisor immediately called park wardens on a satellite phone to raise the alarm A rescue party was on scene within minutes but Dafoe said the students and supervisors initially rescued by the guides had already begun work on digging out their fellow skiers People were searching the snow digging he said As many as people managed to get to the site to help with the rescue said Dafoe All but three people had been pulled out within minutes It was a huge co operative effort he said It occurred very rapidly The group s three adult supervisors and remaining seven students escaped with minor injuries Those who died were asphyxiated coroner Chuck Purse said Sunday Red eyed teenagers and their parents began arriving early Sunday at Strathcona Tweedsmuir School a private school on an expansive c us in the foothills southwest of Calgary A team of grief counsellors began working with about members of the shell shocked school community Principal Glenn Odland said Sunday a third party investigation would conduct an inquiry into the preparation that went into the trip but said the three adult supervisors were well prepared and had extensive training The avalanche risk for the alpine area above the students was classified as considerable by Skjonsberg s office that day but the risk was only moderate in the treeline area where the students were skiing But the avalanche travelled a kilometre engulfing the teenagers and their supervisors UPDATE David Heyman Calgary Herald Monday February Skiers from Strathcona Tweedsmuir High School had four or five seconds to react to a massive slide of snow powerful enough to take out buildings The slide was so large it contained at least tonnes of snow according to information provided by the Canadian Avalanche Association It was huge said Eric Dafoe public safety co ordinator for Glacier National Park who was on the scene shortly after the avalanche occurred He rated the slide as a three or on a scale of five At that level an avalanche can bury and destroy a car or small building and snap trees An avalanche rated as one is relatively harmless to people whereas an avalanche rated as five could destroy a village or a forest Dafoe added the skiers would have had no time to get out of the avalanche s path He said the slide fractured the snowpack at a depth of between and centimetres It swept about a kilometre downhill and was about to metres wide barrelling down the hill towards the skiers Seven of the skiers died and all were Grade students at the Okotoks area school The survivors included seven students one parent chaperone and two teachers The seeds of Saturday s avalanche were sown last November when a particularly unstable layer of snow was created at the beginning of a very unusual season This layer has created problems throughout the season but on Saturday the instability turned into a massive avalanche Last month another avalanche swept down nearby Durrand Glacier burying a group of backcountry skiers Of the people buried in that avalanche seven people died Dave Skjonsberg manager of the avalanche control section of Parks Canada said Saturday s slide started well above the treeline where the avalanche risk was rated considerable but swept into the areas below where the risk was rated moderate Although technically you could say they were at treeline the avalanche did not start at treeline he said The avalanche initiated in the alpine It progressed below the treeline and the results were tragic He said the area around Revelstoke has had one of the most unusual snow seasons in the past years and that s created very unstable sections in the snowpack especially areas laid down in November upon which newer snow has rested An investigation has been launched into the cause of this avalanche It started small at around a m Saturday high above the treeline on the west shoulder of the north face of Mount Cheops about three kilometres from the Trans Canada Highway It was first spotted by two backcountry skiers from Golden who were relaxing on the opposite side of the Connaught Valley They had just passed the group of students and three guides from Strathcona Tweedsmuir School and knew to their horror they were in immediate peril RCMP say one man shouted Avalanche avalanche avalanche but it was already too late The small slide quickly dug into much deeper snow further down pulling with it hundreds of tonnes of snow The entire mass quickly accelerated down the mountain in a plume of mist and debris Such was its speed and force that it swept around a corner part way up another mountain before flushing down the Balu Pass Trail where the students were burying all skiers Clair Israelson managing director of the Canadian Avalanche Association in Revelstoke said the avalanche moved extremely quickly The people involved had very little chance to do anything prior to being hit by the snow This was a large avalanche This would have been big enough to destroy your home or a train UPDATE REVELSTOKE B C Avalanche avalanche avalanche A shout from a fellow skier was the only warning a group of students and three adults from the Calgary area had on Saturday Five seconds later a huge wall of snow crashed down on the skiers burying some as deep as four metres A frantic rescue attempt followed with survivors making heroic efforts to save their classmates People pulled from the snow immediately dug out others still below One student brushed the snow from a classmate s mouth and tried mouth to mouth resuscitation In the end seven teenagers six boys and a girl died Their day had started routinely The students and their instructors from Strathcona Tweedsmuir School near Calgary set out early Saturday on the annual Grade backcountry ski trip to Glacier National Park west of Banff Overnight snowfall had added to the light but steady accumulation on the mountains around Rogers Pass The temperature was around Warm southwesterly winds blew across their trail as they left the parking lot at Connaught Creek Parks Canada had warned that avalanches were possible in the higher alpine areas but were unlikely below the tree line where the group was skiing Just before noon the avalanche started as a small snow slide high on Cheops Mountain It grew steadily as it barrelled down It was a rolling wall of snow one kilometre long and to metres wide by the time it thundered into the valley and pushed up the far side with enough force to wipe out a building A skier near the school group saw the slide and screamed avalanche three times as the group moved along a trail about three kilometres from the parking lot not far above the valley floor Five seconds later the group was under snow some four metres down The survivors were saved by the intensive efforts of a rescue team of people including Armed Forces personnel Sergeant Randy Brown of the Revelstoke RCMP detachment said two experienced backcountry skiers saw the avalanche and realized a group of skiers was caught in it The rescue team which arrived at the scene minutes after receiving the call for help included seven helicopters local ski guides six avalanche search dogs park wardens ski patrols and members of the Forces who normally deal with avalanche control at Rogers Pass It took one hour and minutes to find the entire group Coroner Chuck Purse said the seven students died of asphyxiation After reviewing reports by the RCMP and a consultant he will decide whether to hold an inquest into the backcountry deaths Dave Skjonsberg manager of Parks Canada s avalanche control section in Revelstoke said the region s weather was highly unusual The mountains have had little snow It is one of the most unusual winters in years Survivors were airlifted out of the park and brought to Revelstoke about kilometres west of Glacier National Park With swollen red eyes the parents along with the survivors siblings accompanied the children yesterday Some of the students with bruises on their faces could be seen boarding a bus One student has a serious leg injury Several family members appearing stunned declined comment The deaths come two weeks after an avalanche killed seven skiers in the same region of British Columbia This winter people have died in B C avalanches An average of people die in Canadian avalanches annually Parks Canada the B C Coroner s Office the RCMP and the school announced investigations to discover what had happened and whether anyone could have done anything differently School principal Glenn Odland said the skiers were highly skilled and well equipped The group leader was a certified backcountry guide and the other adults were trained and experienced he said The elite private school about minutes south of Calgary offers six trips a year for students to experience the backcountry UPDATE By the time they wake Saturday morning Parks Canada has already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountry skiers In tree line and alpine areas the avalanche risk has been assessed as considerable the mid range of the five possible ratings Below the tree line the risk is assessed as moderate with natural avalanches unlikely And the STS group intends to stay below the tree line throughout its telemark expedition to Balu Pass But the bulletin also refers to weak snow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failed to stabilize There were similar references for the same mountain range in avalanche bulletins last month just before the deadly slide that claimed seven lives near Revelstoke B C The group makes its way to the Rogers Pass information building a macaroni shaped structure with a sod and timber roof to pore over the latest information Mr Nicholson goes inside He asks about conditions in several areas before heading back to the students and two other adults a fellow teacher and a chaperone The group decides it is safe to ski that day By a m they are on the trailhead to the pass five kilometres away described by backcountry enthusiasts as an easy but beautiful trail They ski through forest along a rocky creek over a snow covered bridge and into the Connaught Creek valley Surrounded by mountains and deep powder snow the scenery is breathtaking Reminders of past avalanches are everywhere Relentless slides tearing down either side of the valley over the years have littered the area with rocks and stumps Foliage is sparse on the valley floor The school group successfully crosses four avalanche prone paths on the north side of the valley and three on the south side They note that the debris from one avalanche path across the valley is no more than a week old They are halfway to their destination It s a soft grey morning The ground is blanketed by eight centimetres of fresh snow The temperature hovers around zero The past hours have been avalanche free and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountry skiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass in eastern British Columbia They are not alone The mountain guides spot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popular Balu Pass Husband and wife pause to say hello It s a beautiful day out here isn t it says Abby Yes someone responds They leave the teenagers and three adults behind climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treed area Abby looks back at the people below and a gangly teen all arms and legs catches her eye Aren t kids funny Look at that kid she tells Rich At that very moment just before noon on Saturday something gives way on the rugged north face of Cheops Mountain Abby and Rich hear a thunderous roar They watch in horror as a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley picking up speed and debris The school group is directly in its path Rich screams Avalanche Avalanche Avalanche The skiers look up The guide s frantic warning comes too late The avalanche hits them head on In a matter of seconds all skiers are swept away in a huge terrifying tangle of snow rocks and trees The swiftness and power of the avalanche sounds like a freight train moving at high speeds Abby thinks A huge roar The power of that much snow moving at the acceleration of gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way Nobody could have got out of the way Nobody The river rush of snow engulfs the skiers then separates them A section of the slide breaks away and keeps going carrying a number of victims hundreds of metres down the valley Disoriented and tumbling head over foot with little chance to swim to the surface this unlucky group ends up as much as metres beneath the concrete hard snow Up in the trees Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are dusted by a thick cloud of powder A terrible silence falls over the valley Though their hearts are thumping they shut down their emotions On goes the search and rescue switch one they have trained for years to put into practice They race down to the first group of buried skiers The only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legs poking through the snow The others in the toe of the slide at the bottom of the valley are buried much deeper Alone at the scene the husband and wife team is faced with heartbreaking decisions Who to save first Not everybody would make it they reason But those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival Rich runs for the first hand he sees and begins digging It s A N He finds Mr N s shovel so the group leader can dig himself out and moves on A N has a satellite phone and calls for help But for the next minutes except for the victims Rich and Abby are there by themselves working to free as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow The guides transceivers work perfectly honing in with beeps and flashing lights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons like shouts from the grave The couple follows the rules of avalanche rescue like clockwork Only dig to a victim to make sure he or she is breathing Clear snow from the victim s face No CPR before moving on to the next victim There are too many Let survivors dig themselves out Once free the numb and distraught living do their best to help The victims are scattered beneath the snow Rich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible The first five people they pull out survive Those survivors go on to rescue others Everyone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead The grim lottery of who shall live and who shall die is over Seven students make it Seven do not An hour after the avalanche seven helicopters three dogs and more than individuals are on site By p m the final victim has been dug out One survivor with a broken ankle is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital The remaining survivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the park warden s station The bodies go too They are laid out on mats in a makeshift morgue in the same building Chuck Purse Revelstoke s part time coroner is investigating his second seven death avalanche within two weeks He examines each body in turn None show signs of major injury They were simply swept away and buried dying from asphyxiation On Saturday Feb Grade students from Strathcona Tweedsmuir School south of Calgary set out on a backcountry ski trip up the Balu Pass in Glacier National Park B C At around a m they were caught in an avalanche that killed seven of them Here is the sequence of events on that day Before departing the leaders checked with the National Park staff for current avalanche conditions They were advised that the threat of avalanches was moderate below the tree line and considerable above it Students were equipped with personal avalanche beacons probes and shovels At a m students left A O Wheeler Hut by van and headed to Rogers Pass Information Centre where they conducted at least one test for avalanche risk a m Commencement of trip up the Balu Pass trail Following standard procedure the one teacher led and the other adult leaders followed at the rear of the skiers who were metres from each other a m About halfway up the valley an avalanche slid off the ridge of Cheops Mountain burying the group Two skiers about metres ahead helped rescue the teacher in the lead who contacted wardens by satellite phone p m Six students were reported alive p m Wardens arrive p m All students were accounted for including the seven who lost their lives p m One of the students was tobogganed back to the motel with a broken ankle Meanwhile helicopters joined the rescue and airlifted students to the motel parking lot from where they were transported to a private home in Revelstoke How the avalanche happened A small slide began high up on the ridge of Cheops Mountain above the south side of Connaught Creek Valley This set off a huge second slide that crashed into the valley bottom with such force that it rode high up the opposite wall as it was redirected eastward down the valley burying the group of skiers Analysis Jan Avalanche Bulletin for the NORTH COLUMBIA REGION WEATHER The past week has seen light to moderate snowfall at relatively warm temperatures accompanied by moderate south westerly winds Freezing levels were around m on Friday and were forecast to lower to valley bottom by the end of the weekend As the flow turns more north westerly this weekend weather forecasters predict continuing light to moderate precipitation through Sunday accompanied by moderate NW winds SNOWPACK Last weekends warm precipitation event produced a substantial crust up to about m when temperatures dropped Wind slabs from to cm thick have formed above this layer from treeline up into the alpine mostly on North and East aspects Subtle weak layers within this recent storm snow are a concern heading into this weekend as wind and continuing precipitation will continue to add to the load A series of buried surface hoar weaknesses in the upper two metres will also come under increasing tension as loading increases AVALANCHES Significant avalanche activity earlier in the week has tapered off although isolated human triggered thin slabs were still being reported on Thursday With continuing wind and snowfall this weekend it will still be possible to trigger avalanches in wind loaded areas near treeline and above FORECAST OF AVALANCHE DANGER UP TO MONDAY EVENING FEBRUARY ALPINE Considerable TREELINE Considerable BELOW TREELINE Moderate TRAVEL ADVISORY Watch for areas of significant wind loading at all elevations and take note of any signs of instability such as cracking and whumpfing Cornices will have weakened with the warm weather If they fall they can easily trigger avalanches on the slopes below so keep an eye peeled to slopes above whenever visibility allows UPDATE B C Solicitor General Rich Coleman said he s considering emergency funding for an avalanche bulletin to be published every day Currently the warning is published three times a week Coleman said he may be able to announce funding later this week that would allow the bulletin to be published for the rest of the season The government had previously cut funding by for this year But no matter how much information is available some people will still decide the risk is worth the back country experience Coleman said He said the government will consider ways of lowering the risk but no one can ever eliminate it entirely Coleman said it would be like closing highways to stop car accidents UPDATE Snow scientist Bruce Jamieson author of numerous books on avalanches noted that government funding of avalanche awareness in Canada accounts for only per cent to per cent of the total amount spent That compares with per cent in the United States and nearly per cent in Europe he said The British Columbia government which withdrew a large chunk of funding last year from a critical avalanche warning bulletin is now considering increasing its share of the costs to allow the bulletin to appear every day during high risk periods UPDATE Sunday February The B C government has agreed to pay for more frequent avalanche warning bulletins after two deadly slides that killed people in eastern B C in the past month Solicitor General Rich Coleman told an open cabinet meeting Friday the province will pay for a series of extraordinary bulletins warning backcountry travellers of elevated avalanche risks It will raise one more level of awareness Mr Coleman said but added it won t eliminate death The commitment is less than what the Canadian Avalanche Association in Revelstoke B C had hoped for It wanted enough money for daily bulletins The association currently produces three bulletins a week during the winter Under the new funding arrangement if something significantly changes between those bulletins such as freezing rain severe temperature variations or increased avalanche activity the provincial cash will provide for additional bulletins The number of special bulletins will be determined by the weather but a government spokesman estimated there could be six over the remainder of the season meaning an expenditure of an extra Mr Coleman said the entire process of issuing a special bulletin will take no more than three or four hours Seven Alberta high school students died in an avalanche on Feb while seven adult skiers were killed in a slide on Jan Both avalanches occurred near Revelstoke The B C government pulled out of its funding arrangement with the association in Until that time the province had covered half the cost to produce three bulletins a week The association has been able to continue producing bulletins by raising money in the private sector A seven day a week bulletin in winter would cost Rescue Mode helicopter Injuries fatalities Source Canadian Press Globe and Mail Contributing Cause s AVALANCHE Top Copyright The Alpine Club of Canada All rights

'STEVE SHIPOOPY SCHNEIDER Speed Freak Interview with Steve Shipoopy Schneider May Melbourne Australia The first time I saw Steve Schnider was in a climbing video He was explaining the ins and outs of competition climbing on a tiny wall in what appeared to be someone s backyard I remembered this espically because I wondered at the time Who is this guy and why the hell have they let him on this video His little skit was very funny but he seemed to be too much of a clown I wondered why they hadn t picked a serious climber for the role This I was to find out was my first introduction to what seems to be Steve Shipoopy Schnieder s motto seriously but never seriously It was later that I found out that Shipoopy the name Steve Schneider sounds too serious for this guy wasn t just the court jester he was also a very serious climber The clown I saw in the video was a certified UIAA course setter At this stage he has climbed over routes graded climbed El Cap times he is at the cutting edge setting new records of speed and endurance He s definately more than a clown Australia holds a very special place for Shipoopy as he owes his initial break throughs to Australian influences He climbed in Europe under the tutorlege of Kim Carrigan Carrigan who was one of the top climbers at that stage took him under his wing to train as a prodigere This had a strong influence on Shipoopy as it was competing with Carrigan that he realised his potential He laughs as he explains how Carrigan would get a little tweaked when his supremecy was challenged by this unknown American upstart Sometime later Shpoopy spent three months climbing in Australia Here again he was influenced by Australia Under the influence of the locals he abandoned his purist ethics and starting hangdoging The results amazed him and showed up pretty soon He climbed his first three s at Arapps Ogiver Slinking Leopard and India He has climbed over since Shpoopy has now made a name for himself speed climbing in the Yosemite Valley Along with the likes of Hans Florine Peter Croft and Dave Schultz he has helped push speed and endurance records to amazing levels At one point he set the speed record for the Nose hrs minutes He has set endurance records by climbing three grade VI big wall climbs in one day pushes all in one week West Butteress VI A Chinese Water Torture VI A and Dihedral Wall VI A All these climbs were done in fastest times to date This feat remains unrepeated With Hans Florine he climbed three El Cap routes in a day Nose VI A Lurking Fear VI A and West Face VI b His climb Circus Circus reputed to be the most sustained climb in America when it was put up in still awaits a second ascent This foot route has successive pitches of c a c c a a It took days to put up and he red pointed the route without taking any falls He s definately the unchallenged clown at his circus I caught up with him on his second trip to Australia He was on a lecture tour but he still found time to climb tell bad blond jokes give instructional clinics and ofcourse laugh Shipoopy is a man who is as serious about having fun as he is about having more fun Have you done any climbing in Australia Ten years ago I was here I climbed in Australia for three months and in New Zealand for six weeks I had a great time I actually led my first here in Australia Which one was that Ogiver was my first and then I did India and Slinking Leopard That must have been a real break through for you It was a breakthrough I adopted the hangdog tactics of the locals I used to be very pure and not like hanging on the rope I started doing what the locals did and began to climb really hard I really liked it Do you plan to do any climbing this trip Oh yeah I climbed Ozymandieas Direct with Abby Watkins We got some good information and we broke the record first try by seconds Briefly could you tell me a bit about the history of speed climbing in the Yosemite valley It s a long proud history The forefathers Robins Roper those guys always took a watch along in the s and s and saw how fast they could go I spoke to Roper one of the pioneers in the s who wrote the first guide book and he felt that there was a bit of a competitive thing going on from the out set People would go up there with a watch and measure up their time If someone broke a record someone would get really pissed and shatter that one They would get this record war going on they are still going on Hans Florine would get his Nose record broken and would go back better it Then Peter Croft would beat it He figured the only way to keep it there would be to tie up with Peter Croft They set the record that s held on for years now and good luck to anyone who wants to beat that That s over how many feet of climbing Approximately feet That s absolutely flying If you wanted to divide by pitches you ll get their minutes per pitch That s pretty impressive too Is there any official way of measuring the time The way speed climbers are measured when the first person starts climbing that s when the clock gets started and it is stopped when the last climber and or the haul bag is pulled up over the edge When the guy s jumars hit the anchors that s when the clock stops Has speed climbing developed because of the intensity of the scene in the Yosemite valley I think it s just the competitive nature of man The thrill of victory and the drama of athetlic competition You see it in the Olympics and it just transfers over to climbing Partly because there are some really great climbers that have gathered in Yosemite and have got really good at doing these things Seeing that you have done so much speed climbing what do you think of the early speed ascents that were done in the early s by people like Royal Robins Especially without the modern gear like friends I think its phenomenal They were banging pitons Steve Roper did the first grade VI in America back in the Regular Route on the Half Dome He was gambling They didn t have head l s back in those days Basically if they got caught out by night they would have to shiver it out till the morning Steve says he remembers being there before first light of the day piton in his hand just waiting for it to be light enough so he could see where to put it He just charged it He probably put pitons in and out with his partner Jeff Foott that day Surely no one have had used that many pitons like that They just finished up in the light of the day I just find it phenomenal that they just had this amazing craft of using pitons fast not over driving them That art of using pitons like that is lost because we use friends in anything over a one inch crack In Steve Roper and Jeff Foott climbed the first grade VI in a one day ascent Why do you think it took nearly a decade for that feat to be repeated Well partly because the Half Dome is ft and the Nose is ft So it was another big step up No one actually thought he could do it Could you describe the reaction of the climbing community when the North American Wall was climbed in a day in October It was the route which was considered to be the hardest in the world when it was first climbed in There was alot of debate behind that Guys like Peter Croft said that those guys climbed it in Steve Gerbeding Scott Stowe and Rick Lovelace were that honest Peter Croft enraged those guys because he said you guys didn t do it Now we are going to go up and do it in a day To Gerbeding it didn t matter because they had done it single push It didn t matter if it was or The thing is that they had gone up without the haulbag and done it There were mixed reactions to that There was a claim to the first true one day ascent of the North American Wall when it was done by Hans Florin and party when they did it in hours something The thing is that wouldn t have done it that fast or felt that they could do it that fast unless Steve had done it before them Despite the mixed reaction it was a big milestone In the North American Wall was considered the hardest technical rock route in the world It was that route that brought a real notoriety to the Yosemite Valley To have that route be climbed in a single push was absolutely mind blowing to the first ascentist and alot of other people myself included Are you familiar with that route How many pitches is it Around ish Haven t climbed it yet Saving it for that one day onsight Laughs How does speed climbing differ from normal big wall climbing The main thing is you don t have a haul bag and you have to be willing to climb at night Not having the haul bag frees you from alot of extra work It also gives you the commitment that you have to get up the wall otherwise you are going to have a really uncomfortable night out You are committed to climb fast You ve done your ground work You ve done your grade IVs your grade Vs in a day You are ready to go fast You ve got less water Because you are committed to going fast and going at night You just do it Are there any major differences in technique It s not so much technique Alot of it is just beta How to do these routes faster When to combine pitches Basically its the same thing leaning cleaning hauling You just keep your ropes really neat Have a team of three working efficiently together as a team has been worked to a perfection in the last few years more than anything In one week you climbed three Grade VIs in one day pushes West Buttress Chinese Water Torture and the Dihedral Wall What were your thoughts at the end of that week What s the next step Can I do four in a week What s the next challenge My body went through alot It was a real test of my body Every once in a while I want to test it to see what it can do and really push it I was just amazed that I could go on like that It s seeing what I can do then learning from that and maybe adding on to it somehow It s a progressive thing Has anyone else done three Grade VIs in that short a stretch of time Well I did three El Cap routes in a day But they weren t onsight routes so that was a different thing That particular trifecta hasn t been repeated How many times have you climbed El Cap times as of this conversation I hope to get to by the end of the year What s the attraction of climbing it that many times Oh its fun You can go up on a weekend and blast it in a speed climb You come down and you are absolutely hammering You go back to work Monday morning and you don t even care because your hands are just raw You have this huge smile across your face when you do the Captain Its absolutely addicting totally phenomenal when you are up there and it s fun Better than a carnival ride times ten What was the initial reaction to John Bachar and Peter Croft s one day ascent of the Nose on El Cap and the Regular Route on the Half Dome I think there wasn t too much surprise I think people realised that it could be done I had done two El Cap routes in a day So it was just a natural progression that someone did People who didn t know what had gone on before might have been surprised but really it was one of the next steps in things to do Could you tell me a bit about your climb Circus Circus It was reputed to be the hardest sustained route in America It has successive pitches of c a c c a a Does it still hold that reputation No Salathe the Nose the Direct Route all free on the Half Dome are all harder It was up there in It was one of the hardest for sure Top three long hard routes There were very few routes that were that long that had multiple pitches of on them Atleast that I know about It was just a personally satisfying thing to do I wasn t out there to put up the hardest single free climb I was just drawn to this amazing line that I could see from the road I just had to do it Fate and destiny kind of control my life in these things There are just some things that I had to do I was so amazing that that climb was even possible when you look at it from the ground It looks desperately thin and it looks like it isn t going to go and it does barely Still awaits a second ascent Speed climbing is obviously extremely intense Things like the Peter Croft and Dave Schultz duo climbing pitches in a day sounds absolutely incredible Those guys are a phenomenal team But even they had limits They tried to do a quadvecta They did Higher Cathedral Rock by Mary s Tears climbed the Rostrum climbed the West Face of El Cap went to do Astroman and they were getting tired Peter remembers getting to the top of the second pitch and Dave s hanging off a quarter inch bolt with a bomber friend crack right next to him Peter couldn t for the life of him explain to him that he should have backed up the anchor He was like Huuuuh whaaat They realised that they d better get down They ve been pushing it too hard They couldn t tell the difference between a hallucination from a bolt But its rad they tried it Those two formed one of the best speed climbing teams ever Their Rostrum time is like They just free soloed this thing They simol climbed this thing and they were fast When I did it with Wally it took hours That s four or five times as long The times involved are incredible enough and then they get bettered constantly You soloed the nose in hours something and then Hans Florine comes along and does it in hours I did the Nose in and Hans climbed it in He really shattered that record To top that that was his first rope solo ever How does the climbing differ style at Toulomie Meadows differ from Yosemite Yosemite valley is characteristic of very parallel cracks that lack alot of face holds These force pretty hard difficult finger wrenching toe binding climbing maneuvers Toulomie has all these protuberances or knobs and face edges You can climb vertical faces much more naturally there than in the Yosemite valley For me it developed a technique of being very technical on dead vertical faces with my feet Being able to stay on really tiny edges really came to be an art form in Toulomie You see alot of climbers who climb at Toulomie John Bachar Kurt Smith and Ed Barry in competitions their foot work does them wonders In your article Sea of Domes you describe the tension the ethical wars has created there The clash of ethics between ground up climbers like John Bachar and rap bolters such as Ron Kauk Oh yeah I don t think Ron s ever forgiven me for that article Its never been the same between us but I just told it like it is When you do something as public as chopping someone else s route I think you have to live up to it If you aren t ready to do that maybe you shouldn t do it in the first place I chopped bolts once and it was a big mistake I was sorry the next day I was drunk when I did it I learnt my lesson I ll never chop bolts again There was a big issue of ethics when Toulomie was started to get repelled placed bolts I wanted to keep it a traditional area to do routes from the bottom to the top What was going to happen was that these routes were going to be done quicker than I could have done then in the traditional way The rock would get used up because it is so limited It came to a point where I had to make a choice weather to keep my friends or my ethics I chose my friends I chose to accept rap bolting rather than fight against it and make a bunch of enemies So rap bolting is becoming very popular there Yeah it s done all the time I never do it though because I still love that adventure of not knowing if a routes going to go I wouldn t ask anybody else to put routes from the ground up I don t push any kind of ethics on any other people You want to set the bolts in the right place sport climbing is an easier way of doing it I manage to put the bolts in the right place by spending years doing it and being smart about it ground up style But I think everybody has to just do what s right for them I will respect them for that Do you ever think the Toulomie testpiece Bachar Yerian will ever be rap bolted It might be possible but they would get chopped I would chop them if someone did that That would be a blight to everyone who has gone up there and gotten the guts to do that route That would be shitting on them It would be bringing it down from another level You can fall from almost anywhere on the route and you won t die you ll get hurt So its not like you are looking at a death fall You have to really build yourself into this spiritual mind awareness plane of really keeping your mind in control in the face of a big fall It s been one of the best experiences People have come from all over the world to do that route So anyone who would put bolts into that I can tell you would be slandered for life At the end of your article you sign off as a wanna be alpinist Have you done any alpine climbing I climbed Denali a few years ago I went to Patagonia and looking to go to California and do some peaks there I want to get into it I would like to go to the Himalaya and do some really high peaks Would you be interested in doing something like what Wolfgang Gullich did in the Trango Towers Free climbing up that high I would like to do those sort of things but I don t know who practical it is to really free climb there To free climb in the mountains takes a long time You are not going fast and speed is safety in alot of the mountains Don t get me wrong I would love to go up to the Trango Towers and free climb the Eternal Flame that Wolfgang and Kurt did in Phenomenal route but in a way its not that practical you ve gut to have decide whether a certain section might take you two days to do My whole speed climbing background has given me this attitude of just getting to the top getting down and then getting on something else More summits I want to do more Quantity not quality I want to do it all Do you have any big projects planned in the near future I ve been injured for nine months since my honeymoon It s a tendon thing a honeymoon injury I have no big projects planned except getting healthy I plan to do some walls because that doesn t hammer my wrist as much as extreme free climbing I dream of getting back to really hard climbing back up to the level of but I keep getting injured left and right In the last three years I ve broken three ribs kayaking broken my leg in two places climbing last year and three months later I injured my tendon wind surfing I m just having a hard time staying healthy right now MAIL ME HOME PAGE',119
