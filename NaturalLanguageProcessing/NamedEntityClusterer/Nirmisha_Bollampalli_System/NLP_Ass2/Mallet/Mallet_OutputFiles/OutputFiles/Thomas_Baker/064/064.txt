BAKER Genealogy BAKER FAMILY HISTORY GENEALOGY From A Genealogical Record of the Moses Baker Family In Dorothy Merrifield wrote a book entitled A Genealogical Record of the Moses Baker Family This book is no longer in print therefore for the benefit of descendants of Moses Baker in their quest to find information on this family I will attempt to include a small part of the book on this web page The book is pages long and I am in possession of photocopies of only a portion of this book The book is no longer in print If you have any information to add to the information below please contact me at CMElaine aol com Thanks Elaine Powell The introduction of the book reads as follows Much has been written about the early Bakers of Nansemond Isle of Wight and Surry Counties Virginia and of Gates Chowan and Bertie Counties North Carolina John Bennett Boddie in his books Southside Virginia Families Vol Virginia Historical Genealogies and Seventeenth Century Isle of Wight County Virginia has devoted many pages to the families of Lawrence and Henry Baker Bodie suggest that the Bakers were from Sussex and Kent England and that they first settled in Virginia in the early seventeenth century Lawrence Baker was granted land in Surry County Virginia in He was a member of the House of Burgesses from to He died in and left his estate to his widow Elizabeth and his daughter Catherine who was the wife of Arthur Allen Boddie SS p A Henry Baker was also a resident of Surry and he patented land in He died in leaving his estate to his wife Sarah and his children His daughters were Rebecca Mary Susan and Elizabeth His sons were Henry Edward and William Boddie doesn t attempt to establish a proven relationship between Lawrence Baker and Henry Baker but it is very likely that they were either brothers or father and son Ibid Boddie continues with the family of Henry Baker of Isle of Wight County Virginia He suggests that Henry of Isle of Wight may have been the son of Henry who died in Surry County Virginia in Boddie believed that Mary Baker Henry s wife was a daughter of John Blake of Nansemond County Virginia but in the year Ex Judge B B Winborne a descendant of Henry Baker wrote an article about this family which was published in the summer issue of the North Carolina Genealogy pp and it was his belief that Henry Baker married Mary Bennett one of the daughters of Edward Bennett of Isle of Wight County Virginia Edward Bennett had another daughter named Sylvester or Sylvestra who married Major Nicholas Hill Henry Baker was a wealthy merchant and when he died in he left a large estate to his wife and children The names of his children were Henry James Lawrence William Sarah Mary Catherine and Elizabeth The land that he devised to his sons Henry William and Lawrence fell within the boundaries of Chowan Precinct North Carolina and when Hertford County was established their lands were within the boundaries of Hertford County North Carolina NCG pp For more information about this early and very interesting family the reader is referred to the books mentioned below This book is about the family of Moses Baker A Moses Baker died in Isle of Wight County Virginia prior to His widow Elizabeth married Edward Riddle Moses Baker had at least one son Moses Baker Jr In Moses Baker Jr sued his stepfather Edward Riddle for the estate that his father Moses Baker Sr had devised to him in his last Will and Testament A few months later Edward and Elizabeth Riddle died and letters of administration were granted to Samuel Rollyson who had married Hannah Baker one of Elizabeth s daughters An attachment was awarded to Moses Baker Jr against Samuel Rollyson for many valuable articles which had belonged to Moses Baker Sr In one of his declarations Moses Baker Jr stated that he was the godson of Colonel John Powell and he also sued to recover the property devised to him by the last Will and Testament of Colonel Powell Boddie IW p and VHG p The next reference to Moses Baker was his marriage to Elizabeth Brown on January in Elizabeth City Virginia Thirty years later he died His Will is recorded in Chowan County North Carolina He left a wife three sons and three daughters The following is an excerpt from his Will Being very sick and weak in body but of perfect mind and memory I bequeath unto my well beloved wife all my estate during her natural life or widowhood only to my three daughters the cattal which are called theirs at the day of marrige to my son Moses my niegar fallows to my son Benett my gun and belt to my son William one cow and cow calf at the age of also a bed the rest of my estate to be divided after my debts are paid my friend Richard Minshen and my wife my whole and sole executors Wit Aaron Blanchard Jurat William Hill and William x Wesson Jurat Chowan January Court NCA WB p Please keep in mind the names of the witnesses to Moses Baker s Will Notice that Moses Baker named his second son Benett As stated on the beginning page of this introduction Mary Bennett married Henry Baker and Mary s sister Sylvester Bennett married Major Nicholas Hill A Moses Hill died very early in Chowan County North Carolina and left a Will but it was said to be illegible Grimes p William Weston who was one of the witnesses to Moses Baker s Will was married to Catherine Blanchard daughter of Benjamin Blanchard An excerpt from the Will of Benjamin Blanchard follows Upper part of Nansemond County June Benjamin Blanchard Sons Robert Land on Beverdam Sw in Chowan Precinct N C Absalom Benjamin Land on Beverdam Son in law William Weston wife Catherine Executors Wife Catherine and son Robert Wits William Hill James Grising Thomas Roundtree Grimes p William Hill also a witness to Moses Baker s Will married Mary Spivey a daughter of Thomas Spivey William Weston and Robert Blanchard witnessed Spevey s Will Mark Chapel was a legatee of Thomas Spivey Grimes p A Richard Hill died and left a Will in Craven County North Carolina in His heirs were Daughter Ann Jones son in law Evan Jones granddaughter Elizabeth Hill Exr Brother Francis Hill Grimes p On page four of this book please note that Margaret daughter of Michael Baker married a man named Evan Jones This Evan Jones was no doubt a grandson or grandnephew of the Evan Jones mentioned in the Will of Richard Hill In Moses Baker was the executor of the Will of Richard Chappell It is assumed that this Moses Baker was the son mentioned in the Will of the Moses Baker who died in Chowan County North Carolina in An Excerpt from the Will of Richard Chappell follows Chowan County N C March Pro Oct Richad Chappel s Will suggests a close family relationship He may have been the brother of Eliza Chappell We know that Moses Baker married Elizabeth Brown in in Elizabeth City Virginia and that he died in in Chowan County mentioning three unnamed daughters in his Will Eliza may have been one of those Richard Chappell named his eldest son Moses probably after Moses Baker Since Richard Chappell didn t appoint his son Moses as his executor it may be that he wasn t of legal age Below are abstracts of two deeds involving Moses and Bennett Baker DB C p Bertie Co N C Jan Moses Baker Yeoman sold to Benjamin Holleman acres for pounds land on the east side of Chinkapin Creek adjoining John Smith at Flatt Sw and Kellum Wits John Wynns John Smith W Evens May Ct BD C p Bertie Co N C May John Smith yeoman sold to Bennett Baker miller acres for pounds on the East side of Chinkapin Sw adjoining land of James Holley bequeathed to Jane his wife by the last Will and Testament of our father John Smith Deceased Adjoining James Williams Wits John Wynns John Freeman Thomas Parker Bell pp and These two deeds prove that Moses and Bennett Baker sons of Moses Baker of Chowan County North Carolina owned land adjacent to each other on Chinkapin Creek in Bertie County which later was in Hertford County when that County was organised They lived in the same County as Henry and Lawrence Baker and were neighbors to James Williams Moses Bake sold his land and moved to Edgecombe County North Carolina In he witnessed the Will of George Williams An excerpt of that Will follows Edgecombe Co N C July Pro June Will of George Williams Sons George Samuel Dau Cloe Dec d sister Lucretia Williams Extrix Wife Priscilla Wit George Crudup Moses Baker and John Norwood Grimes p Moses Baker who died in Edgecombe County North Carolina in and who was the progenitor of our family named his eldest son Michael perhaps after Michael Brinkley who witnessed the Will of Richard Chappell He named his second son Aaron after Aaron Blanchard who witnessed the Will of Moses Baker who died in in Chowan County His fourth son Thomas married Penelope Williams who was the daughter of Thomas and Margaret Williams Thomas and Margaret Williams also had a daughter named Priscilla She may have been named after the wife of George Williams Watson N C Estate Records All through the genealogy that follows you will find the names of Smith Williams and Jones the same family names associated with Moses Baker in Bertie and Edgecombe Counties North Carolina Although Henry Baker and Lawrence Baker lived in the same general area as Moses Baker in Chowan Bertie and Hertford Counties of North Carolina I have not found any evidence that they were related unless the relationship occurred in the early s in Nansemond and Isle of Wight Counties Virginia There seems to be no similarities of names carried on by the two families Although I believe that Moses Baker who died in Edgecombe County North Carolina is a descendant of Moses Baker who died in Chowan County North Carolina in despite all of the evidence however interesting I have been unable to prove a direct relationship Therefore I begin A Genealogical Record of the Moses Baker Family with Moses Baker of Edgecombe County North Carolina Dorothy Merrifield THE FIRST GENERATION MOSES BAKER was born ca probably in Virginia and he died in in Edgecombe County North Carolina He wife s name was Sarah and on October she testified in Court that she had received her share of her deceased husband s estate from Jesse Baker the executor BD p Moses Baker had formerly lived in Bertie County North Carolina on Chinquapin Creek sometimes called Chinkapin His brother Bennett Baker lived next door Chinquapin Creek was a branch of the Chowan River which was the dividing line between Bertie and Chowan Counties When Hertford County was formed in Chinquapin Creek was in that County Other Bakers living in the area were William Baker and his two sons William Jr and James Benjamin Baker Henry Baker and Blake Baker Bell pp Moses sold his land in Bertie County in and he moved to Edgecombe County North Carolina SOMETIME BETWEEN AND MOSES BAKER AND HIS SON MOSES BAKER JR SERVED IN THE MILITIA IN THE COMPANY COMMANDED BY CAPTAIN SOLOMON ALSTON Captain Alston s Company guarded the soother area of Edgecombe County that later was cut off to form the northeast part of Wilson County in Hugh Johnston In Meady Bozeman deeded one acre of land to the Protestant Ana Baptist Church on Town Creek Town Creek branched off of Sw Creek a branch of the Tar River Moses Baker was a member and a trustee of the church Other trustees were Miles Scarbory John Stokes William Scarbory and James Scarbory Witnesses to the deed were Malachi Mounts and Jesse Drake DB p Edge Co N C I have estimated the birthdates of Moses Baker and his children in this way Michael Baker the eldest son of Moses Baker died in and he was the father of ten living children Two of his sons were of legal age when he died as he appointed them executors of his Will That means that they were born before Subtract twenty one years from and we have the approximate date of Michael s birth which would be about Thomas Baker the fourth son of Moses Baker was married January to Penelope Williams If he was twenty one years old or older when he married then he would have been born about Jesse Baker the youngest son of Moses was married and the father of four sons when his father died in His eldest son was born in That would place Jesse Baker s birthdate about Moses Baker had eight children Michael Baker b ca d Surry County N C married to Anna Moses Baker b ca d ca in KY m to Mary Vickers Aaron Baker b ca d m Martha Jameson widow of John
