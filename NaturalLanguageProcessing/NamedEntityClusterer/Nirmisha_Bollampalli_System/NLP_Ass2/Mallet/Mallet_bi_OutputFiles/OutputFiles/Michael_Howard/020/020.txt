Technorati The growth of interconnected computers in recent years has pushed security concerns to the forefront of development and application design The Microsoft effort dubbed the Secure Windows Initiative SWI focuses on securing new and legacy code A key player on the Secure Windows Initiative team is Senior Security Program Manager Michael Howard Michael has a long history working on security related issues and has written two books along the way Writing Secure Code and Designing Secure Web based Applications for Windows both from Microsoft Press Erica Wiechers co host of the NET Show on MSDN sat down with Michael recently for an update on the security effort Here s what he had to say MSDN Microsoft is heavily focused on security issues these days How has the thinking about security changed over the past few years at Microsoft Howard Simply put threats have changed and all software must adapt to reflect the changing and frankly more dangerous landscape Security and by security I don t mean security features I mean secure features is at the forefront of everyone s thoughts at Microsoft What was previously the domain of a small bunch of specialists is now part of daily life in the various Microsoft product groups It s part of getting the job done And Bill s January e mail on Trustworthy Computing has added a huge impetus and urgency to the process MSDN What is the main charter of the Secure Windows Initiative group at Microsoft Howard Our role is simple help product groups build more secure products Our ultimate goal is to put our group out of business by seeding product groups with expertise helping them design develop test and document their products correctly and securely All product teams should get to a stage where their security effort is self sufficient over time but we are in the building phase right now so our group performs a great deal of hand holding until the teams can run on their own MSDN Describe your role in that group Howard I have many roles including security education research consulting and writing The education aspect is critical in general it s rare to find new developers who understand how to build secure software so our group fills that gap I probably spend an average of six hours a week educating people I also spend time researching things such as new threat modeling methods determining attack profiles and new vulnerability types Because of the SWI charter I also spend a good chunk of my time working with other product groups to make sure they are on track answer questions go over designs code threats test plans and so on MSDN What are some projects you are currently working on Howard You name it We just finished working with Windows XP SP and Visual Studio NET now we re onto Windows Server SQL Server Microsoft Office the next big Visual Studio NET release and much much more MSDN What do you see as the biggest challenge that developers face while trying to code secure applications Howard Legacy code is definitely the biggest challenge in that respect We think we have the new code pretty much solved People know the right things to do now that we have provided mandatory training set security rules in place improved the tools and created a huge security awareness company wide However attackers target legacy code as well as new code and the role of the various security pushes is to fix issues in both old and new code We can task people here at Microsoft to review and fix all code old and new and make it part of their job MSDN What security features would you like to see incorporated into future Microsoft products Howard I would like to see people not focus on security features In fact I truly believe that the biggest security benefit we can provide our customers is to install only critical features by default If the user wants to enable other features then they should be optional installs I say this because we can create products that defend against the threats we know about today Of course there will be new threats in the future that we do not know about today and if a feature has such a vulnerability and it is installed by default the user of that particular feature is automatically susceptible to attack and will need to deploy a security fix quickly However if the feature is rarely used and not running by default then it cannot be attacked Therefore the path deployment urgency is vastly reduced In short if a feature is not used by percent of the product s users then the feature should be disabled by default From the March issue of MSDN Magazine Back
