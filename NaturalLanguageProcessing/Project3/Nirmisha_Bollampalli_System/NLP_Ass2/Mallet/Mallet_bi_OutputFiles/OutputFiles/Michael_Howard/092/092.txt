Americas Issue February Offline Michael Howard Principal analyst and co founder Infonetics Research by Ted McKenna Sun February Living in the San Francisco Bay area in the s and s Infonetics Research principal analyst and co founder Michael Howard got to see the emergence of the free speech movement first hand So the question is did he wear tie dyed clothing and have long hair Oh sure I was a programmer and the programmers that I worked with we were the hippie types Howard says The engineers were more likely to wear the ties to work Michael Howard Title Principal analyst and co founder Infonetics Research Age Resides Santa Rosa Calif Length at Current Position Years Education B S in Mathematics University of California at Berkeley After his graduation from UC Berkeley Howard helped develop operating systems and programming language compilers for Arpanet though he didn t know that Arpanet would evolve into the global phenomenon called the Internet At the time I thought it was amazing that all these different kinds of computers could talk to one another and that scientists and researchers could talk with one another Howard says It was all absolutely fascinating but there was no way I imagined it was going to become what it is Still a resident of northern California Howard says he enjoys diving on the weekends for abalone a single valve mollusk that can be found attached to the rocks near shore at low tide The meat is delicate and tasty and so good You re allowed to collect three a day and up to a year and from three abalone you can get something like a pound or two of meat Howard says After I get a couple of hours in the water I end up feeling as refreshed as if I had spent a couple of days in the mountains Looking back too much money was invested in the telecom industry Did you know that at the time No I was caught up in it Everything that people were thinking was going to happen will happen it s just that it hasn t happened as quickly as we thought We continue to see a doubling or tripling of Internet traffic every year It may not be every days like it used to be but there s still a lot of growth For one thing there s video coming people will be able to get it as easily over their phones as on their TV at some point At times some analyst firms have seemed partial to publishing hockey stick shaped charts predicting massive growth in various industry segments Were you ever guilty of that I think one of the things Infonetics has always done is be more conservative in its predictions We don t just listen to manufacturers or carriers We try to find out who is buying what from manufacturers and we check with manufacturers to see what they ve actually shipped so that we can come up with realistic estimates Is the management corruption uncovered lately at some telecom companies a reflection of the industry or simply a sign of the times I saw a e from management consultant Peter Drucker a year or so ago that four times in the past years we ve seen the pendulum swing back and forth between governments getting too lax on corporations corporations taking advantage as a result and the government getting tougher again Right now I think you could say the pendulum is swinging back Certainly technology is changing the social fabric of the world and when it s a time for entering new territory the rules haven t really been written about how people should act and so companies naturally take advantage Telecom helps make possible the outsourcing of jobs like software development to countries outside the U S Do you think that s bad or good I think economies just have to adjust A lot of people like to use the ex le of railroads in the s It was a disruptive technology and it allowed communications to a better extent in that the mails were carried more quickly and goods were more easily transported and that changed the social order Telecom isn t moving actual goods but it s moving information which is along the same lines and it will have a huge impact on how people and governments around the world do business GSM Is Money Transfer New Killer App February Ericsson Acquires Entrisphere For GPON And IPTV Technology Expertise
