Descendants of George Baker of Pownal VT Early History of the George Baker Family of Bennington Co VT and Otsego Co NY EARLY HISTORY OF THE GEORGE BAKER FAMILY OF BENNINGTON CO VT AND OTSEGO CO N Y Compiled by Zervia Barnes Birdsall and Mildred Birdsall Covert George Baker was one of the pioneer settlers of Pownal Vermont This place was first settled by the Dutch in but the town government was not organized until when the town was named in honor of Thomas Pownal governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony It formed part of the territory know as the New H shire Grants over which there was so much trouble with New York as that colony claimed the land which really belonged to the New England territory The first known reference to George Baker contained in early records is found on page Vol I Vermont Historical Society Collection where his name appears with other residents of Pownal as one of the signers of a petition to the King dated Nov in which the King is requested to restrain the New York colonists from further encroachments on the New H shire Grants Prior to nothing is positively known concerning George Baker but it is believed that he was born in Massachusetts about Some papers belonging to Leroy Baker of Osceola Tioga Co Pa record statements made by Chauncey Baker son of George whose father was Daniel Baker to the effect that Daniel s father George Baker of Pownal Vt came to this country with two brothers one of whom was Col William Henry Baker But as no other record to substantiate this has been found it seems more probable that he was a descendant of Edward Baker of Lynn Mass who was a freeman of that town in and who died there in The New England Genealogical and antiquarian Register Vol V p contains considerable data concerning this family in substance as follows It is known that this Edward Baker had five sons possibly more Joseph and Timothy of North ton Edward and Thomas of Lynn and John of Dedham Timothy was the leading character of North ton He had five children John Thomas Edward Prudence Deliverance The oldest son John Capt John Baker lived on the old homestead in North ton and was one of the most influential men of the town He had seven sons John Noah Aaron Elisha Stephen Timothy Elijah and two daughters All the sons except Timothy who died while on the expedition against Louisburg married and settled in western Massachusetts all lived to be years old or over and all left numerous families whose descendants are all over the United States from Vermont to Texas Perhaps George Baker was son one of the younger sons of Thomas or Edward sons of Timothy Baker of North ton or it may be that his father was one of the other sons of John Baker who was the oldest son of Timothy The early records of Pownal town give the following data about George Baker and some of his family In the earlier records the name is spelled Bacor but afterwards Baker There were six school districts in Pownal in the early days and the fifth district is described as follows Beginning at John Matison s north to George Bacor s thence to Bennington line going east on the First District all to be one district A deed given by George Gardner to Benjamin Gardiner recorded in Vol II of the town records gives one boundry as follows thence running to the old fence now standing where George Bacor once lived This deed is dated the nd day of February in the th year of His Majestie s reign that is Feb as George III became King in The clause where George BAcor once lived is significant as it proves that he had changed his place of residence in Pownal prior to Vol II of the records contains several lists of Pownal freemen and of those who took the freeman s oath for the first time in certain years The list of those resident in include George Baker and the same list records Joseph Briggs afterwards Capt Briggs and many others who were in Briggs company with George Baker and Daniel Baker in service of the United States during the Revolution The list of those who took the freeman s oath in all of whom must have been years old or over gives Daniel Baker probably the son of George This lists in the early records of Pownal are fast becoming illegible and for that reason they are given Names of Freemen of the Town of Pownal Elder Benjamin Gardner Nathaniel Seeley David Page Peter Robards Stephen Perigo John Lareby Stephen Osborn Charles Wright

records By this deed dated and recorded April David Page conveys to George Bacor both of Pownal a parcel of land situated in the N W part of Pownal bounded as follows Adjoining west on a lot of land lately owned by Capt Briggs now the property of Abel Parker north on a A lot laid out for the use of schools in Pownal town east on Francis Bates land south on the highway north of Jonathan Cards land containing A and is the th division lot laid out to the right of Nathaniel Phelps original grantee in said town of Pownal The price paid was s Vol III records that November Josiah Bates conveyed to George Bacor for the sum of a small tract of land adjoining the property he bought of David Page Vol V records the transfer of the above properties by George Baker spelling changed in this deed to Benjamin Gardner and Silas Card of Pownal The total purchase price was The date of sale is February and the deed was recorded February No other records of property transfer to or by George Baker occur in Pownal records and it is supposed that he went to Otsego County N Y directly after the sale of his Pownal farm This farm of A is situated in the hill country a few miles from Pownal Center in the N W part of Pownal township It is now part of a A farm owned by Mr Frank Wilson but is still called the Baker lot A complete record of all transfers of this property with description of boundries and other interesting matter has been compiled and is now in possession of the historian The place where the old house stood overlooks the highway which led from the Vermont settlements to those near Albany N Y Looking to the south one gets a beautiful view of Greylock the most famous of the Berkshire Hills and it is worthwhile to remember that George Baker and his family sturdy pioneers living there so many years ago looked daily upon a landscape which is now one of the most famous in all New England Vol III records the purchase of property by Wm Bacor possibly a son of George who bought A of William and Gardner Hall July the price being In Wm Baker sold this land except a small tract containing a mill and in he sold the mill with its surrounding plot No further records of property owned by Wm Baker appear in the Pownal records He probably went to New York State perhaps to Otsego County According to tradition he afterward went to Philadelphia and became very wealthy The first census of Vermont taken in records George Baker as follows George Baker Pownal Town free white males of years and upwards including heads of families one free white males under years two free white females including heads of families three no other persons no slaves This means that in there were only four children at home two boys under sixteen probably Joseph and Stephen and two daughters Asa and Susan The Vermont Revolutionary Rolls p record George Baker and Daniel Baker as having served in the company of Capt Joseph Briggs from October November The Vermont records are very incomplete and no known record exists to prove that George Baker took part in the battle of Bennington but family tradition and abundant proofs of his residence in Vermont in the vicinity of Bennington from to make one certain that such service was rendered Perhaps he was a member of Col Herrick s body of militia or of Capt Dewey s company in Col Brush s militia Egbert Baker of Harpursville who died in had the powder horn which according to tradition was carried by George Baker in this battle Egbert received it from his father Reed son of Thomas to whom it was given by his Reed s grandfather George Baker Mr Ezra Stevens an old resident of Milford recalls some stories of the Revolution which he heard told by Thomas Baker s children He says that George Baker and three of his sons were at Bennington battle and that Thomas who was but a lad went with his father s team to help clear the slain from the field The records in possession of Leroy Baker see p also state that George Baker and three of his sons were soldiers in the Revolution Mr Stevens says that one of the older sons Abel Aylesworth Baker was a colonel in the Colonial army Ezra Stevens father William Stevens came to Otsego County in and lived for many years near Schuyler Lake When he went to live in the town of Milford in some of the Bakers were there and it is supposed they came in the early s perhaps in The first recorded deed of property owned by the family is that of the Thomas Baker farm A from the Otego patent purchased in December of William Temple Franklin through his agent William Cooper The price paid was s d Since this farm near Milford N Y has been owned by some member of the Thomas Baker family It is now the home of Ralph Baker son of Warren L whose father was Leonard son of Thomas son of George Baker of Pownal Edward Baker s farm was also from the Otego patent bought of Thomas Mumford in November A for s d The first recorded deed of property owned by George Baker in Otsego County was placed on file March though the farm was purchased in It contained A and was distinguished as farm or subdivision B of lot No in the A of land on a branch of the Susquehanna River and Cherry Valley Creek granted by letters patent to Volkert Outhoudt and six others It is probable that George Baker lived on this farm some years before he owned it The farm was purchased of the executors of Catherin Lawrence of New York City and the sum paid for it was of good and lawful money of the United States The descriptions and legal terms of the old time deeds differ from those of today and as a matter of interest and as something of a curiosity the following ation from the deed of the property to George Baker is given Folio s p Records of Conveyances Otsego County N Y Samuel Lawrence Robert Watts Junior Stephen N

executors and that it is not incumbered and that the title is clear S Lawrence Executor R Watts Jr Executor S N Bayard Executor J W Patterson Executor Witness for identity of men Daniel Ryan appeared Feb before P J Hildreth Master in Chacery Recorded March o clock p m Immediately following the record of this deed the transfer of this farm March by George Baker and Elizabeth his wife to their son Stephen is recorded the date of record being March when George Baker appeared before John Russel Judge of Common Pleas and acknowledged the deed The farm remained in Stephen s possession and he lived there until his death February After Stephen s death his son Daniel had the farm until February when it was sold by him ad administrator to Moses and Ester Chidester of Milford From time to time the Chidisters sold portions of the farm until only A remained of the original A This remaining plot changed hands several times and March it became the property of Edward Seeger who paid for it In he sold two lots one of A and one of A and in November the remaining A were deeded to his son Dudley Seeger who son Levant now owns what remains intact of the farm George Baker purchased in The historian has a complete record of all transfers of this farm from The house in which Mr Seeger lives was built by Stephen Baker but several changes from the original plan have been made since Edward Seeger became the owner Originally there were two large fireplaces These have been removed though the foundation of the great chimney about feet square is still standing in the cellar It was impossible to remove this as the whole structure rests upon it The house is very desirably located on a gently sloping hill on the west bank of the Susquehanna River The view from any point is attractive The winding river merging into Goodyear Lake the thickly wooded hills that bound the valley the uplands from the flats occupied by prosperous farmers whose homes are most inviting and just to the south the little church at Milford Center with its white spire above the clustering maples a landmark of historic prominence all this and much more makes the old homestead seem a goodly heritage and one is glad to recall the valley as a place toward the settlement of which one s ancestors contributed both labor and capital It is interesting to know that the site of the first school house in the town of Milford was on the George Baker farm In this log school house which stood a short distance to the north of the Baker homestead the Baptist church of Milford Center was organized by Rev Josiah Morris March and George Baker lived to be a very old man A Mr Rowland of Milford who died several years ago at some years of age told Alfred Baker of Laurens when he acknowledged the deed of his farm to his son Stephen and November when Mr Stevens was born The vital statistics were poorly kept during the early days of Pownal and they contain no record of the marriage of Geoge Baker or of the birth of any of his children It is supposed that he married Polly Brown perhaps about and that they had ten children as followes Abel Daniel William Charles Edward Thomas Asa a daughter Joseph Stephen Susan It is possible that the wife Polly died before George Baker left Vermont indeed that may have been the reason for his disposing of his Pownal farm in and going to New York State where several of his children had already established homes The deed of the Otsego County farm to the son Stephen in is executed by George Baker and Elizabeth his wife but the last name of the second wife is still unknown Nine of George Baker s children married and it is positively known that Daniel Edward Thomas Joseph and Stephen came to Otsego County N Y Probably Asa and William were for a time in Otsego county The following information concerning the ten children mentioned above is of interest to all descendants of George Baker ABEL BAKER The records of Seneca County N Y under date of March give Abel Baker as a resident of the town of Owasco County of Cayuga and record the sale by him of some Seneca County property The deed is witnessed by Elisha Baker In the Cayuga records the first entry under Abel Baker April records him as paying for a portion of lot No in the town of Sempronius Various other records follow which Abel Baker and Aurora Baker his wife transfer parts of this plot in lot No receiving in all much more than was paid for it If the family records are true in respect to George Baker s son Abel going out Seneca County way the entries mentioned must refer to him as no other Abel Baker is given in Seneca or Cayuga records prior to or from to Newell and Lorenzo Baker of Seneca County grandsons of Abel Baker were in the Civil War with Harrison T Baker son of Russel son of Thomas of Milford N Y DANIEL BAKER The town records of Pownal Vermont record Daniel Baker as having taken the Freeman s oath in so he must have been at least years old at that time He is known to be one of George Baker s older children and it is probable that he was in the Revolutionary War with his father On p of the Vermont Rolls a Daniel Baker is recorded as having served in Capt Joseph Brigg s company from October to November the same company and service as that of George Baker Family tradition has it some of George s children came to Otsego Co several years before he did Chauncey Baker states in the records which Leroy Baker has that Daniel came to Laurens N Y when his son George was about years old or about but is seems probable that he came earlier than that Possibly the Daniel Baker recorded in the first census as a resident of Otsego town Montgomery County N Y is this Daniel Baker The following is given concerning him Free white males over years two free white males under years two free white females three The first recorded ded of property owned by Daniel Baker is that which conveyed to him in a A plot in Otsego County in Lot No of the Otego patent granted to Thomas Wharton and others Daniel Baker s estate at the time of his death comprised several hundred acres as there are records showing that his son George bought of Daniel Baker s heirs A March of Nathan Baker and his wife Hannah A of land belonging to the estate of Daniel Baker and a little late A more July also A of Benjamin Howe and wife the plot being described as part of the lot belonging to the heirs of Daniel Baker In December James Green and Asa Baker Green his wife signed over their claim to her brother George which leads one to conclude that George Baker son of Daniel may have acquired title to all of his father s property These records establish the fact that Daniel Baker must have died between the year when he purchased the A plot and March when the first sale of property belonging to the heirs of Daniel Baker is recorded His wife survived him many years The county records state under date of May that Susannah wife of Daniel Baker deceased of Laurens deeded to George Baker a A lot Early family records give the name of Daniel s wife as Anna Cumins either he was twice married or the name Anna was short for Susannah Daniel Baker had ten children Nathan b m Hannah

record of names and dates is not strictly accurate nor is it sufficiently complete to warrant publication This brief history is of more importance than the genealogy would be as much of the information has been obtained from records that many of the family cannot consult conveniently Sufficient data is given to enable any member of the family to prove eligibility for membership in the patriotic societies Sons of the American Revolution and Daughters of the American Revolution provided his or her ancestry can be traced back to George Baker of Pownal Vermont or Daniel Baker his son also of Pownal The first descendant to join the DAR on the service of George Baker was Harriet Lorena Birdsall admitted February of Binghamton New York daughter of Zervia Barnes Birdsall whose mother was Lovina Baker daughter of Stephen son of George Baker of Pownal Other members of the family in the Stephen Baker Daniel Baker and Thomas Baker lines have joined this Society and without doubt the

the next settler at Milford Center He came in purchased a farm just north of Mr Mumford s large purchase which is owned occupied by Dudley Segar at present Mr Baker had seven sons two daughters His sons names were Abel Daniel Charles Thomas Edward Joseph Stephen His daughters names were Asie Susan Mr Baker sold his farm in Vermont when he removed to Milford there was remaining unpaid on it He sent his oldest son Col Abel to Vermont for the money He collected the money that was the last ever heard of him It was believed by some that he skipped with the money by others that he was robbed murdered At all events he was never heard from after he received the money Mr Baker s th son Thomas married Sarah Morton located at Edson Corners Edward married Hannah Mumford Charles Stephen Joseph all married raised large families Daniel married Susannah Anna Cumins Charles Stephen and Joseph all married and raised large families and located in different towns Edward Baker s oldest son George left home and went to New York in and never returned to Milford He remained in the city and when the T______ cholery broke out in it was supposed he was one of the subjects for he was never heard from after His daughter Linda and his youngest son Mumford Baker removed to Pennsylvania Both married and never returned to Milford George Daniel s son married and settled in Laurens Stephen remained on his father s farm in Milford Center until his death He had one son Daniel who married Nancy Keyes sold the old farm that was first settled by his grandfather and returned to Laurens The following served in the Northern Division under Arnold Gates and Stark Col Abel Baker major Gidean Marlette Privates George Baker Daniel Baker Charles Baker Artemas Ward James Frasier James Westcott Lemuel Lilly George Baker and his three sons Abel Daniel and Charles and Judah Waters and Jacob Wellman participated in the battle of Bunker Hill and afterwards Abel Baker Judah Waters and Jacob Wellman were transferred to the regular army under General Washington Biographical History of the Baker Family George Baker the senior of the Baker family was born in England before and was persecuted for his religious proclivities consequently he took refuge in Holland He joined the Puritans and embarked in the Mayflower with the Pilgrims and came to America and landed at Plymouth in Mr Baker afterwards settled near Boston Massachusetts I think that George Baker the first Baker that settled in Milford was a grandson of the Baker that came from England George Baker of the first Milford one of the settlers was at Concord Lexington and Bunker Hill At the battle of Bunker Hill his three oldest sons participated with their father in the fight His sons names were Abel Daniel and Charles Abel was promoted to the office of Colonel and after was under Washington in the main Army It is stated in an antecedent chapter that Abel was sent to Bennington by his father to collect a sum of money and that was the last that was heard of him That was a mistake It was learned after that he procured the money and with what he had of his own he went to Philadelphia and went to speculating and became immensely rich But he never returned his father s money The old gentleman when he earned the facts in the case felt very much grieved over his misconduct towards his father He was a man that stood high in the community and little did he think his son would resort to so comtemptible and outrageous an act as to rob his father of his money when he had placed confidence in his integrity The old man felt very much grieved and said he deserved severe punishment The poor old man had the misfortune to die a horrible death from the effects of a cancer Mr Baker was in the hard fought battle of Bennington under General Stark who said we will win this battle or Mollie Stark will sleep a widow tonight Mr Baker sent for his son Thomas to fetch his horses to carry in the wounded and disabled soldiers and tell the people we have killed all the Indians and Tories this side of hell Census Bainbridge Chenango County NY Chauncey Baker age b NY Abigail age Eliza age Henry age Erastus age George

born Sept in PA Lee M age born Sept in PA Baker Chauncey age born Feb in NY with Parents from CT NY Dear Mary I think I ve had a breakthrough on our family tree concerning Chauncey Baker On the Mormon website at www familysearch com I found an entry for a Chauncey Baker who was born on Feb in Milford Otsego County NY to Susan Nott and George Baker and died in in Knoxville PA I knew our Chauncey Baker was born in Otsego County around that time so I sent to Pennsylvania for his death certificate which showed him as dying in Shippen PA on October and being buried in Knoxville PA on October The death certificate listed his father as George Baker and his mother as Susan Knox It also says that he was born on Feb in Otsego County NY I still wanted more evidence that this was our Chauncey so I checked out the Census records to see if there were any other Chauncey Bakers around the same age In the index to the census I found five Chauncey Bakers Our Chauncey Baker was years old living in Bainbridge NY Of the other Chaunceys one in Allegany County was years old too old to be confused with our Chauncey Another in Granger County Ohio was age also too old to be confused with our Chauncey The remaining two were Chauncey S Baker a year old clergyman who was born in Vermont living in Lancaster NY and Chauncey Baker age living with his year old wife Emeline in Sodus NY I then looked for these three Chauncey Bakers in the census The Census index showed four Chauncey Bakers born around the same time The first was born in Maine and was living in California definitely not our Chauncey The second was the Chauncey S Baker born in Vermont and still living in New York State the clergyman from the Census The third was a New York born Chauncey Baker living in Antwerp Michigan with his wife Emmaline obviously the Chaucey from Sodus NY The remaining Chauncey was living in Deerfield in Tioga County Pennsylvania He was years old born in New York living with a wife named Lucy in the home of his son James Baker aged also born in New York Since this last is obviously the Chauncey Baker who died in and we know he was born in Otsego County like our Chauncey I feel certain that this is probably our ancestor Since our Chauncey was married to an Abigail in and the Tioga county Chauncey was married to a Lucy I am guessing that he remarried after Abigail s death sometime between and I did not find Chaucey or George Baker in the Census in either Bainbridge NY or Shippen Knoxville or Deerfield Township Pennsylvania I did find George Baker aged in the Bainbridge census I also found Chauncey in the Census for Shippen in Tioga County Pennsylvania He was living with his daughter Libbie A Schoonover born Feb in PA and her husband Chester Schoonover They were living next door to Charles L Baker born April in PA and his family I think it is likely that Chauncey and his family moved to Pennsylvania between and and that George Baker returned to Bainbridge NY before According to the Mormon website George Baker the father of Chauncey Baker was born in Pownal Vermont on April to Daniel Baker and Susanna Cumins and died on Sept in Laurens NY His father Daniel was born around in Pownal Vermont to another George Baker and Polly Brown Daniel died on March in Milford NY Daniel s father George Baker is listed as having been born in Massachusetts in and having died in Milford NY on November I looked up George Baker in the Censuses The Census shows him age living in Laurens NY with his wife Susannah age and five children He is listed as having been born in Vermont and his wife is listed as having been born in New York In the Census they are now alone He is age and she is age They are both listed as having been born in Connecticut I also found a website at http www rootsweb com nyotsego histmil htm which is titled EARLY HISTORY OF THE TOWN OF MILFORD AND OTHER PARTS OF OTSEGO CO From to by EZRA STEVENS It includes a lot of information about the Baker family and how Daniel and George fought in the Revolutionary war and were among the first settlers of Milford NY Some of the information is not completely accurate however They claim the Bakers go back to a George Baker who fled to Holland for religious freedom and then came over on the Mayflower I checked the records and there was no George Baker on the Mayflower Perhaps it was an ancestor by a different name who came on the Mayflower I also doubt that they took part in the battles of Lexington and Concord since they lived in Vermont If I find anything else I ll let you know I plan to look for Chauncey in the censuses and to see if I can find his burial records in Knoxville PA Perhaps I can find Abigail s burial as well Wish me luck Your cousin Tony Research Update Census confirms that the Chauncey Baker in Tioga county Pennsylvania and the Chauncey Baker who lived in Bainbridge New York in are the one and the same Chauncey his wife Abigail and their children Eliza Henry Erastus George Jonathan
