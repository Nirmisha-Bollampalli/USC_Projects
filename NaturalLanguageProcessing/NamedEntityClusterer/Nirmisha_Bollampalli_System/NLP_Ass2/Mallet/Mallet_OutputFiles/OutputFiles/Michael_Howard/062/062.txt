Failing to Resonate With the British Public By Glenn Frankel Washington Post Foreign Service Wednesday April Page A NOTTINGHAM England Michael Howard was hammering home the need for more policemen on the beat before a television studio audience the other day in this city in central England where the rate of gun crime has soared in recent years The Conservative Party leader told the audience that his wife and daughter had been the victims of muggings in recent years and he cited statistics indicating fewer criminals were being caught than at any time in the past two decades What makes me really angry is the view that we have to settle for this Howard said It doesn t have to be like this Michael Howard the leader of Britain s Conservative Party is seeking to lead the Tories back into power after two consecutive landslide losses to Prime Minister Tony Blair and the Labor Party By Gareth Copley Associated Press Free E mail Newsletters Today s Headlines Columnists See a S le Sign Up Now Breaking News Alerts See a S le Sign Up Now But just as Howard was warming to his theme Glen Williams deputy chairman of the Nottingham Black Police Association interrupted He told Howard that his arguments on crime and immigration bordered on racism They are emotional and they are pandering to the basest fears of human nature scolded Williams who was in the studio audience Howard stuck to his view but his passion was clearly drained and he soon changed the subject It s been that kind of c aign for Howard who is seeking to lead his party back to power in Britain s election next week after two consecutive landslide defeats at the hands of Tony Blair and the Labor Party Every time Howard s tight disciplined and on target approach appears to be getting traction with British voters someone or something seems to come along to set him back again Under the guidance of Lynton Crosby a c aign manager who has steered Australia s conservatives to four successive victories Howard has kept to a script that has one slogan Are You Thinking What We re Thinking and just six c aign promises that can be boiled down to words lower taxes more police controlled immigration school discipline cleaner hospitals governmental accountability The party s manifesto only pages long once the excess white space is removed is its shortest since The back to basics platform appears custom made for two groups the party s right of center political base and undecided voters who feel uneasy about the direction of British society and want someone to blame Still the c aign lacks the ideological fervor that former prime minister Margaret Thatcher once brought to the hustings Conservatives no longer are arguing that they would cut the size of government but rather that they would run it more efficiently Public opinion polls suggest their case is not resonating with large numbers of voters Survey after survey shows the Conservatives a consistent to percentage points behind the Labor Party Though the Conservatives traditionally do to points better than the polls predict many analysts expect Blair to be returned to office albeit with a reduced parliamentary majority And the year old Conservative Party one of the most successful political organizations in the history of Western democracy is expected to go down to another defeat Analysts point to several reasons for the failure of the Tories as the Conservatives are commonly known Some blame Howard a year old former lawyer and political veteran who was a cabinet secretary in the days of Thatcher and another former prime minister John Major Howard is considered a steady but decidedly un charismatic candidate with a humorless prosecutorial public persona Years ago a fellow Conservative said there was something of the night about Howard a phrase that has stuck The c aign has also been criticized Some analysts contend that the Tories pared down agenda reads more like the shopping list of a party seeking to narrow the electoral gap rather than prepare for government And like Williams the police official some critics contend that the c aign smacks of a racist agenda especially the calls to reduce immigration Howard the son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe indignantly denies the racism charge But the rhetoric of some of the party s parliamentary candidates has fueled the allegation What bit of Send them back don t you understand Mr Blair demanded a leaflet for Bob Spink a Tory candidate who wants illegal immigrants summarily expelled Conservative strategists argue that their program appeals at a gut level to
