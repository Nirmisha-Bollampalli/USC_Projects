ORGANIZATIONS LINKS KEEP TRACK OF AIPAC U S LOCAL NEWS Washington Report November Page Special Report Israeli Arms Sales to Iran By Jane Hunter In September when the Israeli government radio accused Iranian troops of training Lebanese Shiite guerrillas for attacks on the Israeli backed South Lebanon Army and said that Iranians themselves might also have been among those who attacked Israeli positions in Lebanon the US media reported those charges in great detail None found the time or space however to note how ironic it was for Israel to complain about Iranian military activities Iran might have been hard put to continue its costly six year old war with Iraq not to mention simultaneously stirring up followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini in Lebanon if Israel had not been willing to sell the Khomeini government great quantities of the weapons Iran desperately needed to keep its army in the field That is only one of the anomalies of Israel s booming arms trade US law and US policy also come in for some stretching and twisting Over the course of the Gulf war Iran s quest for weapons has become legendary with many countries and hordes of private arms dealers eager to conclude arms deals and reap the premium commissions Iran offers Israel with standing access to the same models of US made arms upon which the Shah based Iran s arsenal and with its desire to build up an indigenous arms industry has led the pack The London Observer estimated that Israel s arms sales to Iran total million annually Before when Shah Muhammad Reza Pahlavi held power Iran was the world s biggest buyer of Israeli arms The Islamic fundamentalist government which succeeded the Shah militantly damned Zionism up and down and hung a prominent Iranian Jew for spying for Israel In however when the Iraq Iran war began Iranian representatives met in Paris with Israel s deputy defense minister and worked out a Jews for arms deal Iran permitted Jews to emigrate and Israel sold Iran ammunition and spare parts for Chieftain tanks and US made F Phantom aircraft Channeled through a private Israeli arms dealer this particular agreement appropriately ended in when Iran was slow in paying its bills Although secrecy is the first principle in the netherworld of arms trading details of several subsequent major Israeli arms sales to Iran have come to light In Ya acov Nimrodi an intimate of leaders across the Israeli political spectrum sold the Iranian defense ministry worth of Hawk anti aircraft missiles mm mortars ammunition and other weapons through his Tel Aviv based company International Desalination Equipment Ltd From to Nimrodi had been Israel s military attache in Tehran On July Radio Luxembourg reported that Nimrodi had met in Zurich with the deputy defense minister and the top intelligence officer of Iran and with Rif at al Assad the brother of Syrian President Hafez al Assad Swiss government sources said that the meeting resulted in a deal to ship truckloads of weapons a day from Israel to Iran via Syria and Turkey On September a DC cargo plane returning from Iran and supposedly bound for Malaga Spain made an emergency landing in Tel Aviv Investigation revealed that the plane recently acquired from an obscure Miami firm by a shadowy Brussels based Nigerian company had been flying Hawk missiles from the US to Iran via Israel A Boeing registered to the company had been carrying loads of TOW missiles from Israel to Iran via Malaga At about the same time the London Observer reported that a ship carrying tons of Israeli material was making a rush delivery sailing directly to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas rather than first going to Zaire where the Iranian buyers would inspect the cargo In May West German authorities foiled an million ammunition deal and uncovered a tank deal in the process Charged in the case were an Israeli and a former Israeli citizen The West German weekly Stern said a telex from the state owned Israeli Military Industries dated April indicated official Israeli involvement In June of this year a Swedish businessman was reported to have acted as intermediary for Israeli sales of explosives to Iran The shipments went from Israel to Iran via Argentina In September United Press International reported that the Danish Sailor s Union had logs and records to prove that since May a Danish freighter had taken four ton shipments from the Israeli port of Eilat to Bandar Abbas in Iran The union was certain the arms were US made Re selling without permission arms acquired from the US and the sale of US weapons to Iran are both prohibited by US law In separate incidents involving sales negotiated within the US federal authorities have arrested two Israeli military reservists and a Yugoslav American Paul Cutter Cutter who has connections to Israeli Minister of Trade and Industry Ariel Sharon and who also told co workers he was authorized to sell arms Israel captured in Lebanon in has been convicted and jailed The Israeli government disassociated itself from these men Now however a federal sting operation has cracked the biggest arms deal yet US Customs Service agents drew retired Israeli army general Avraham Bar Am and co conspirators three of them Israelis into a carefully laid trap last April Tapes made by the Customs Service reveal Israeli government involvement in a billion conspiracy to sell US made arms to Iran through third countries On recordings made available to the Chicago Tribune Samuel Evans a London based American lawyer who coordinated two separate conspiracies to offer sophisticated aircraft missiles and ordnance to Iran is heard to say that he would be discussing the deal with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and that the authority for the transaction went right through to Prime Minister Peres The case is particularly serious because federal authorities presented evidence in their indictment that the deal included phony re export certificates attesting that Israel was re selling surplus arms to Turkey which is legal rather than to Iran which is not General Bar Am claimed from his jail cell that he had an Israeli government license to sell arms Denying any involvement Israeli officials insisted that the license was only to prospect for sales one of a thousand distributed to former military officers The Israelis have worked hard to bolster this contention In late September Defense Minister Rabin called a press conference to say the permit process would be changed to avoid the appearance of government approval But an earlier statement by Ya acov Nimrodi that such sales are government authorized and that permits come from a special department in the Israeli Defense Ministry and are difficult to get contradicts Rabin as have many reports over the years that it is common Israeli practice to sell arms through fronts and agents The US government has avoided dealing head on in public with the Israeli government over this issue When the Bermuda conspirators were arrested it was reported that the Israeli ambassador was called in for a stern warning It is unlikely however that prosecutors will focus on the Israeli government s role when the Bermuda conspirators stand trial in New York this November Over the last six years Washington has several times expressed its disapproval of arms sales to Iran During the hostage crisis Israel was specifically asked to stop deliveries while Iran was holding US hostages and it is possible that Israel complied At an October I luncheon he hosted Secretary of State George Shultz assured diplomats from the Arab states of the Gulf that Israel had told US officials it had stopped selling arms to Iran in Shultz in fact accused the Soviet Union of not cl ing down on sales by its allies to Iran During the Reagan administration US policy has swung through various levels of support for Iraq Israel s often stated policy on the Gulf war is to keep it going as long as possible because the dreadful carnage ties up the combatants and prevents either from attacking Israel In then Defense Minister Ariel Sharon blurted out duringa US speaking engagement that Israel sold arms to Iran because it regarded Iraq as the greater enemy and that the sales had been thoroughly discussed with US officials US officials acknowledged such discussions but denied that Israel had US permission Last spring what turned out to be an Israeli disinformation c aign propounded the notion that the US had asked Israel to sell arms to Iran The tapes in the Bar Am case are said to suggest that the US was considering shifting its support to Iran while the conspiracy sting was being hatched This kind of last ditch Israeli government defense probably supported by pro Israel political obscurantists in Washington has almost certainly been used before When it was revealed that Israel was shipping arms to the Soviet supported government of Ethiopia to fight Western assisted resistance movements and arms to the Argentine junta during the Malvinas Falklands war Israeli disinformationists in Washington sought to argue that Israeli actions which directly contravened stated US government objectives were really part of a double game somehow coordinated with Washington This time arrests by the US government of Israeli players have left no doubt that the US interest is to halt not abet Israeli arms sales to America s enemies Jane Hunter is the editor and publisher of Israeli Foreign Affairs P O Box Sacramento CA
