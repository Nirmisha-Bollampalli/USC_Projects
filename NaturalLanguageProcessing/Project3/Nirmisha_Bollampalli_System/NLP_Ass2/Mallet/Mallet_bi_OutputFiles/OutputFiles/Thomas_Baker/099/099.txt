McMaster University This biography is the first serious attempt to do justice to Thomas Baker McQuesten the Hamilton native who served as minister of highways and public works in Mitchell F Hepburn s controversial Liberal administrations at Queen s Park a half century ago And as the author John C Best makes abundantly clear there is considerable justice to be done But the question immediately arises Why was McQuesten neglected for so long One could speculate that over the years his vindictiveness and remoteness among other flaws paraded out by an author who commendably points to his subject s warts as well as to his more comely features may have made McQuesten a less than appetizing choice for the prospective biographer He may also have proved unpalatable because of his slavish backing of Hepburn a political leader whom many condemned as a crude charlatan and a moral fraud a person hardly fit to be supported by a scion of a leading Hamilton family noted for its devotion to the finer aesthetic things of life Again it may simply have been a matter of a Grit s being considered less than historically worthy and politically correct in the heavy Tory atmosphere that prevailed in Ontario after the Second World War To add to McQuesten s liabilities not only did he fail to win the Liberal leadership after Hepburn withdrew from the scene but his own parliamentary career at Queen s Park came to an abrupt end in the elections that produced George Drew s majority Conservative government At least in the political sense McQuesten ended up as an apparent loser not exactly a front burner subject for the aspiring student of politics Thankfully none of this deterred Best who has performed an important rescue operation for McQuesten and in the process put together a good read as one might expect from a perceptive news executive who plies his trade at a local television station I would put his book in the same league with Neil McKenty s equally lively biography of Hepburn which appeared a quarter century ago Best examines McQuesten s political career at both the local and provincial levels from his aldermanic responsibilities in Hamilton to the organization of Liberal affairs in the city and the province and final ly to his elevation to Hepburn s cabinet after the Grit sweep to power in The author is at pains to point out that politics for McQuesten was only a means to an end an opportunity to acquire the necessary authority and funding to promote his many brain children including the Queen Elizabeth Way that opened in The highways minister we are told was disposed to overlook Hepburn s many blemishes on the grounds that the premier constituted the only hope for safeguarding Liberal fortunes in the province and hence for furnishing the necessary springboard for McQuesten s own cherished projects to beautify the Ontario cityscape and modernize its highway network Was he playing the role of a local Albert Speer The argument however is only partially convincing For all his gentility and supposed aloofness from the political rough and tumble McQuesten appears to have entered fully into the in fighting that frequently disfigured Liberal affairs in Ontario and to have played a major role in the bargaining that led to the selection of party officials and candidates He also shared Hepburn s cordial loathing for Mackenzie King so much so that he saw to it that the prime minister s name did not appear on a commemorative bell lodged in another of his inspirations the Rainbow Bridge carillon at Niagara Falls In any case there is no question that the most compelling sections of the book do in fact deal with McQuesten s varied beautification schemes He sought to enhance urban approaches like Hamilton s northwestern entrance and to provide le and ornamental park space for blighted industrial communities He also oversaw the construction of an imaginatively landscaped version of an Autobahn the aforementioned QEW chaired the work of the Niagara Parks Commission and inspired the planting of floral oases such as the Royal Botanical Gardens in Hamilton The last would not only provide splendid vistas for a citizenry habitually starved of such amenities but ultimately a botanical laboratory for major research As Best demonstrates McQuesten came by all this honestly In the early years of the century he had become infatuated with the international City Beautiful movement and had welcomed ambitious urban planning schemes drafted by outside experts such as Noulan Cauchon all of which shaped his thinking when he became head of Hamilton s Board of Park Management and later the minister of highways The author rightly gives full marks to McQuesten s strong commitment to parks as arcadian retreats and environmental lungs even if much of his imaginative enterprise smacks of the patrician stooping to conquer His otherwise laudable schemes for the multitude might also have been an exercise in what passes for social control particularly in an age ravaged by a crippling depression and stirred by unsettling ideologies of the left always anathema to him and his circle Again it is ironic though typical of his class and generation that while the college educated McQuesten played a vital role in locating McMaster University in Hamilton the first break in a broader culture for the city as he characteristically put it he was quick to suspect professors of being in cahoots with dangerous revolutionaries bent on destroying the world that he held dear For McQuesten the latter included On to Ottawa hunger marchers and those who instigated the bitter CIO strike at the General Motors plant in Oshawa This attractively designed and well illustrated biography is not only readable but scholarly Family papers a wide assortment of archival materials and a variety of newspapers magazines and printed memoirs have been assiduously recruited and deployed to produce an enlightening piece of work All the same some of the entries on secondary sources are too sparse no chapter or page references for ex le and there are some inexplicable bibliographical omissions to name but one John Weaver s history of Hamilton which could have provided helpful and corrective insights And when dealing with political matters Best sometimes confuses an already complicated picture by failing to introduce properly on first mention some of the leading players for ex le Harry C Nixon who beat out McQuesten for the Grit leadership after Hepburn stepped down More seriously he gives insufficient credit to the road builders who came before McQuesten notably Wentworth s expansive agribusinessman Frank C bell Biggs who had served in E C Drury s ill fated Farmers government in the early s But these are comparatively minor criticisms of a welcome study that will clearly benefit students of Ontario politics urban enhancement and regional history
