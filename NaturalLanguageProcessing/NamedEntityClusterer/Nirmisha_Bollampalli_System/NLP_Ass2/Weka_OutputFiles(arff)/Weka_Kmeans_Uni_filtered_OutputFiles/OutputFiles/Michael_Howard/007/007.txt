OUR LOGO A METHOD OF ONE S OWN SELF MARKETING Celebrating Years It is impossible to say how something truly begins Nothing is born in a vacuum To understand how the Michael Howard Studios began it s necessary to go back to the life of the great actor and director Constantin Stanislavski whose groundbreaking approach to the actor s craft led to a system of acting that would change the Theatre forever Stanislavski s work provoked profound responses in artists around the world who came in contact with his teachings During the s the Group Theatre under the direction of Harold Clurman embraced and wrestled with Stanislavski s work A mixture of genius drive and some cutting edge writing created the most important movement in the history of the American Theatre This hotbed was where Lee Strasberg Stella Adler Elia Kazan Sanford Meisner Clifford Odets and other important innovators fostered the revolution that shook the American Theatre In the early s the Group Theatre s brilliant star exploded creating a host of new artistic solar systems In the fall of as a scholarship student Michael Howard studied at The Neighborhood Playhouse with Sanford Meisner After World War II where he served with the st airborne as a paratrooper he began to pursue his acting career and joined Equity in He began studying with Lee Strasberg and then in along with many of his generation s most influential performers he became a member of the Actor s Studio Michael recognized that both of these major teachers made a unique and significant contribution articulating particular truths about acting He vigorously pursued his artistic growth and as a natural extension of his pleasure in theatrical form and the ensemble Michael began to direct as well as act Then when Sidney Lumet asked Michael to replace him at the High School of Performing Arts Michael s teaching career began in earnest Soon after a group of his friends who were meeting regularly to practice their craft asked Michael to lead their sessions That was the beginning of The Michael Howard Studios Most important in its development has been Michael s ability to surround himself with other artists of the highest caliber to complete the faculty The Michael Howard Studios has changed forms and locations several times since then And yet Michael s core belief that there cannot be one way to act that all actors must develop their own method has not changed Michael s classes as well as the Studio at large encompass many schools of thought the influence of the great teachers mentioned above as well as techniques developed by great teachers from around the world Hence a lineage began over a hundred years ago continues The pursuit of the work is enriched with tradition as well as bold new ideas Michael s contribution to our heritage is reflected in the countless numbers of actors directors and teachers who have been his students over the past years and counting About Our Logo More than half a century ago the brilliant clown Charlie Chaplin invited the great musician Igor Stravinsky to his home Documented in photographs in Life Magazine Chaplin brought Stravinsky into his back yard and showed him a large circular contraption about seven feet in diameter The wheel was designed in such a way as for a person to be the spokes Stravinsky placed himself inside with arms akimbo and legs spread as Chaplin rolled him around It is clear in the photographs that both of them are laughing having a blast When Michael saw the magazine article he had an artist take the image and incorporate the harlequin figure symbolizing theatrical tradition So more briefly put the logo represents geniuses at play A Method of One s Own Reprinted by permission from the January issue of American Theatre Magazine published by TCG MICHAEL HOWARD Founder Director Michael Howard Studios New York I taught at Juilliard in the drama division for eight years During that period I continued my private class working with actors who had begun their professional careers Clearly the intensive training at Juilliard had great value for all the participants at whatever level But there were also drawbacks to conservatory training Understandably the actor is not allowed to accept professional engagements a difficult restriction for some an impossible restriction for others Further training institutions admit people into the first year when perhaps the individual should have second year work or perhaps at the end of six months the are really ready to move into the second or third year Obviously none of this is possible Then there is the problem of chemistry that very important relationship between student and teachers It is not just a question of what is being taught but how All teachers have seen that look on the face of a student which says Oh god do I have to spend a year with this person It s like an arranged marriage it s daunting In this studio students sign up for one month at a time It s hard to maintain this organizationally even financially but everyone in my class is in the seat because that s where he or she wants to be I think that s important Also these people have limited study time and money It s possible for me to say Listen stop my class concentrate on your voice work and then come back Actors construct their own university program The vast majority of actors who study at this studio have a goodly amount of previous training And the teachers who teach here come from very different backgrounds I think we would all agree that our job is to help them define their own method Young actors today ask me Do you do Meisner or Do you do Strasberg It s all rather faddish When I m asked What is Michael Howard s method I run I say I don t have a method of acting I suppose I have a method of training I think it s a bit slick but I think it s true I work with actors individually to develop their own method In any important performance the actor is in danger the actor is at risk An actor illuminates the material reveals the playwright by revealing some aspect of him or herself often something private In our theatre there s a great deal of talk about use yourself or just be there In fact that s very important It is the bottom line But it raises the essential question Which self The whole rehearsal process is based on discovering which self the playwright wants you to bring to the work I tell the actors the world needs us desperately whether the world recognizes it or not I demand that they prepare themselves to be the best actors they can be A life in the American theatre means to do and do well commercials a great play which no one sees a soap for a few years a lousy movie that everyone sees a great part in a movie that leads to nothing I think it s a splendid way to spend a life If you re lucky if you hang on long enough and if you ready yourself as an artist you will get work There s struggle and pain but I think making a life in the theatre is worth it Acting is easy it s not a desperately complicated process Some children have done it startlingly well brilliantly well in ways that make you gulp The hard part is becoming an artist which means using all of you not just the comfortable part not just the part the child uses easily and quickly not just the part they buy and want again and again It is when you begin to use the dreadful parts the secret parts as well as the hero parts that the word artist begins to have a very special meaning And that takes time It can happen without any help from anybody it cannot happen without work It happens more efficiently with study There are actors Dustin Hoffman is one working in the commercial theatre who insist that the industry let them stretch who insist that they use the clown part of them or the woman part of them They force themselves to go out and find those parts And they become artists Those who keep repeating don t The actors who aren t getting that kind of opportunity in the business and need a place to extend their work are the ones I can help Not teach them how to act but to help them develop grow extend Self Marketing COMING SOON Copyright
