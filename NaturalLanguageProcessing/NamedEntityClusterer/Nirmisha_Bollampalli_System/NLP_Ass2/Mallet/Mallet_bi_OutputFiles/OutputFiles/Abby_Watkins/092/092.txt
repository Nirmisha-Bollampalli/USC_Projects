Page It s been the worst season for avalanche deaths in over years But those numbers do little to console a community that was hit especially hard The students of Calgary s Strathcona Tweedsmuir were on a school trip in the mountains of B C It was a character building adventure trip one that ended in a horrific tragedy Seven of those children never returned from that trip and today we talk to one of the victim s families A remarkable girl who led a remarkable life Meet Marissa Staddon These are of Marissa in her early days I think Karl took this one when she was just a couple days old And that s her one year old photo This is a picture of Marissa taken at the beginning of school for grade She looks you straight in the eye from whatever angle you re looking at this photograph Marissa started skating at three years of age She loved it She had great capacity and natural ability for it And a year ago was sort of the highlight of her skating time in that she did manage to go to Canadian junior national competition She glowed when she was on the ice This is Marissa with her younger sister Brittany who she loved and adored We had a lot of great times as family together This is in the mountains We started when they were very young taking trips to the mountains few more family vacation photos We went up Heart Mountain which is just east of Canmore by Lacktah s Arch Marissa was ten years of age at that time I think it s feet of net vertical Here she is at the top Memories of the mountains and a mountain that forever changed this family Headlines the helicopter the mountains in black and white Now the memories of mountains are very different This was Marissa s backpack that she took on the outdoor education trip where she was struck by the avalanche It was purchased new this year and fitted to her She was still wearing it when she was buried She was buried about two and a half metres below the surface wearing the backpack Tough going through it I will show you some of the articles that she had in that backpack on the day she was struck Karl and Donna Staddon have found themselves unpacking a storm of grief since their daughter Marissa s school Stratchona Tweedsmuir had it s outdoor education trip turned to tragedy At the time when we hear the news that Marissa was deceased Brittany s response at that time was oh I ve lost my very best friend and she said Marissa has taught me so much and I was looking forward to having her teach me more and more I m gonna miss her so And then she paused and a few minutes later Brittany spoke up and she said well wouldn t you know Marissa was always such a competitor and always looking to go for the gold and here she s won this race she s beat us all to heaven Seven students all years old died in the avalanche and sent their home city Calgary reeling It hits not just parents it hits siblings I mean this covers every relationship group siblings friends parents grandparents everybody felt a sense of loss Licia Corbella is an editor at the Calgary Sun You know that I don t want to use a clich eacute but it was an avalanche of grief First there was the shuttle astronauts that perished And then later that day there was another group of bright lights just disappeared And being that they were young people and such connected young people so involved in so many things it didn t seem that there was any person in this city who didn t know someone who knew someone who knew them Or who knew them personally Everybody just got that sick sense in their feeling of so much potential lost There was a deep sense of sombreness in the city It really made the whole city seem smaller in an odd sense Like a village Because everybody was connected in some way It was very well anytime young people die but to have at the same time all years old all grade students all of them remarkable young people with so much promise it was just shocking It s been Canada s worst season for avalanche deaths A mild winter created the most unstable snow pack Revelstoke had seen in thirty years A reality that claimed lives in days This is an avalanche transceiver All of the students and the adults on the trip would have been wearing one of these You put these around your waist and over your shoulder to keep them secure When the this is kind of like a key when its engaged in this you can see it starts to blink The number of blinks gives you a indication of the battery life And you travel with it in transmit mode And it sends out about every second a small radio frequency And in the event of an avalanche everyone who is above ground or above snow then switches their transceiver from transmit to receive And you then go about trying to locate with this the people that are buried go down to confirm exactly where they re at Because you don t want to dig a deep hole to find out that you dug three feet off of where they re located So this is how they are used And how some of the students were detected and saved as a result by the transceiver That day in Revelstoke it wasn t human activity that began the avalanche it was wind Over a kilometre long crack in the snow loosening itself from the mountain Experienced in wilderness trips the Staddons have gone over all the details of this tragedy We viewed Marissa s body at the funeral home and she looked very much at peace and at rest it gave us a certain measure of comfort that the avalanche itself hadn t caused he a lot of pain from what we understand and having flown over the site later that day she wasn t swept through trees she wasn t swept over cliffs but she was swept a long distance metres we re told from the point she was standing at or skiing at the time she was struck by the avalanche our firm belief is that while she was probably very frightened undoubtedly that she didn t suffer a lot of pain in the aftermath of the avalanche So we drove up to Roger s pass and Donna Brittany and myself together with Jordy Sheppard who was the Parks Canada incident scene commander and the helicopter pilot we flew over the scene for or minutes While we were over the scene and it will help us you know go back and locate the site pretty precisely where Marissa came to rest after the avalanche Could you see it from the air Absolutely it was a huge hole I mean most of the holes were huge Marissa was buried we re told metres down and so they dug out a big pit to reach out her body My understanding is that uh at the time of the avalanche the trip leader was buried save except for his hand which was above the snow we spoke with him the morning after the avalanche he said that he could feel himself blacking out so time was getting away from him as well and Rich and Abby being first on scene saw the hand and were able to scoop down to his face and restore his breathing helicopters were brought to bear over the scene in very short order there were professionals on the ground involved in the location digging and in attempted revival efforts and the kids dug as well the kids dug as well because there was a time lag between the time that the satellite phone call went out and the time Parks Canada arrived Further up the mountain where the avalanche started and you can see how much snow really fed into this avalanche my estimate and I ve also read that Parks Canada I believe have said they estimate in the thousands of tons of snow that came down Parks Canada personnel have also commented uh think in terms of speeds of km an hour I believe I m told and I can t recall whether it was or shovels were broken by the rescuers in trying to dig and extricate those that were buried by the avalanche so again it speaks volumes to the effort the Herculean effort of the rescuers to try to dig these kids out and revive them Marissa always had a disposable camera in her back pack so she could take pictures of her adventures and when we got her back pack back her camera was there and so we took it in and had the film developed and there s a photo here that would ve been taken the day before so on the Friday afternoon when they were out skiing and it s Marissa with the two other girls that were part of the group friends of hers and and it just captures them with great smiles and just enjoying their adventure So are you at peace that the school had done everything it could that this was not beyond acceptable Yes I am and the reason is that I have climbed for over yrs I ve taken advanced avalanche training I ve climbed in these sorts of conditions I had the privilege of travelling with this group of students together with the trip leader in the fall of and nothing came to light in all of our discussion on sun Feb nd with all of the personnel or subsequent to that date that has made me think that there was an error in human decision making I really think it s remarkable that the first person dug out had the satellite phone It s also incredibly remarkable that Rich and Abby husband and wife Rich Marshall and Abby Watkins uh were just ahead had passed the school group and had just missed it were able to come back and be the first persons on scene after the avalanche and if not for their efforts the consequences would ve been considerably worse then they are Karl as I m looking at the gear that she all had and I m thinking about this trip as it was about building character helping students learn how to conquer challenges explain to us what you think goes on in the psyche of a person as they learn to conquer nature I can speak from my own experience and I think most of the students if not all of the students were having similar experiences themselves It s great for building confidence it teaches you to prioritize weight is always an issue the backpacks teaches you to be aware of the environment that you re operating in These are transferrable life skills that you learn in the mountains Absolutely you develop a mind set of how you want to deal with risk and there s also for me and for most of these students that there s a sense of joyousness of being in the mountains you simply see things in the mountains that you do not see in the cities This is the sleeping bag that Marissa took it s one that I ve had for many years but is more than adequate for the purposes of this trip when we return Unpacking what Marissa held in her heart Part All the Calgary teenagers lost in the avalanche were seen as incredible young Canadians and Marissa Staddon lived life large And her friends were such a big part of her life They were a very close knit group They had fun together Studied together And they grew in Christ together They are a group of friends who keep each other accountable That was just so comforting as parents to know that the friends your daughter had were supporting and building helping her to build her relationship with Christ Marissa was an avid athlete not only in figure skating but also with school sports team sports Mainly volleyball badminton and track and field She loved track and field and did very well in relay and long distance And this particular photo was taken in June of her grade year Her friend gave us this photo And on it he wrote on track for the Lord And I just thought that was so wonderful Because that was indeed Marissa Marissa played piano Started taking lessons when she was years old She was currently working on her grade her grade level of piano She also played flute and clarinet and saxophone and also hand bells She used her music for relaxation And then she would go of to skating in the evening she went to the arena for two hours of skating each evening I love this photo Marissa went on last year with her graduation grade class from Glenmore Christian Academy in July to Mexico with Youth With A Mission They built a home for a needy family down there This picture was taken of Marissa on conjunction with her graduation of junior high in June of Its actually the dress she had on for the funeral as well How did you decide that Actually I talked with Brittany Marissa s sister and I said what dress do you think And she said oh mom her graduation dress She loved that I can remember her putting it on and swirling around and going ah this feels good Because both Brittany and I remember so well her joy with that we just decided that that would be the dress we would have for her funeral For her ultimate graduation For her ultimate graduation Perfect Yes We just knew it had to be a celebration and we also wanted to have the plan of salvation to be spoken that word to be given to all who were going to be there because Marissa lived her life solid in Christ and she was always happy to share with others about Christ the difference that was in her life and so we wanted the message of salvation Celebration Service clip Pastor Matheson God so loved you Marissa God so loved you That he gave his only Son Jesus That Marissa that you might not perish So that you may have everlasting life Marissa accepted Christ into her heart when she was years old it was one day when I had picked her up from pre school she attended a pre school at a local church and when I picked her up and put her into the van she said Mom I asked Jesus into my heart today And I said Oh Marissa I am sooo happy for you Marissa did go on being keenly attuned to things of the Lord reading her Bible praying everyday even through her teen years her Bible was always at her bed side and she read every night before she went to sleep Celebration Service Clip Where would you be without Him on this one Despair I think it would be despair but when when we hold onto God he understands our pain he understands our loss he understands our confusion we sometimes feel about all this too but uh there is not despair what we have is hope because um know that God will give us the strength to carry on and that we have the hope and the promise that we will be with Marissa again in heaven because we have asked Christ into our heart we have that commitment we have that assurance that we will be in heaven with God one day and that means that we re gonna be in heaven with Marissa too And that just puts a whole different turn on the grieving that we are going through on this journey because of the hope the wonderful hope that he s given us And when you made your farewell card for Marissa Karl you wrote it differently than most people can you tell us why The we uh look at some other precedent s maybe four or five and most of the other precedents were people who had lived to be maybe or or Marissa only lived to and I thought that was such a pathetically short amount small number and so I calculated the number of days including leap years it was days that sounds like a lot a lot better number So what we wrote in our card was born June th Heaven bound Feb st Precious days and they truly were very very special days we think around Marissa and donna and I were talking and you know I guess there s a couple things one is two scenarios one is we never had Marissa and the other is we had Marissa for that number of days which would you rather have No choice absolutely would take those days with Marissa the second question was Marissa ours or was Marissa God s gift to us for whatever reason and trusted to us to raise her up and it s the later she was God s gift Tribute clip from Celebration Service from a friend Youth pastor Eryn Moore There s no guarantees in life in terms of how long we ll actually live And I think that really caught a lot of our students off guard A lot them really struggled with it at first There was some anger there was some questioning about why God would allow something like this to happen Sometimes I think the best answer is no answer I ve seen God work through this tragedy in amazing ways but I couldn t say to these students God allowed Marissa to die so that these could happen I don t know if that was totally His will I don t know I know that our lives are short That God never promises us any time of life on earth Life is a gift This is an assignment for language arts when she was in grade eight It s a poetry project and they can choose any theme of their own that they would like and they have to write poems Marissa chose the theme of God When her sister when Brittany got this out of her closet and we read it through we realised how how wonderful this was for us to have now To have these poems Marissa wrote from her heart And they reflected her closeness with God Her walk her journey with God You have a favourite in here tell us why Yes I do have a favourite The favourite that I have is this free verse which is called A Fresh Start Would it be all right if I read it Sadly standing in shimmering sprinkling snow Shoulders down Face downward Emotionally down cast She ponders wonders cries Tears walking round her face Covering all in their course overcoming the sink before them Why is she alone Why out in the snow Out in the cold Kneeling Bowing Stumbling Fallen in the frost Hands grasp Eyes closed Heart welcoming She finds a Redeemer A Saviour A fresh start I reflect more on it through the lens of the avalanche I don t know that its prophecy but the parallels here are incredible Absolutely incredible It touches me every time we look at it You had a very unique way of letting Marissa say goodbye to her friends it was on a CD that she recorded tell us about that Well in December of Marissa decided she wanted to put a compilation of music together of contemporary Christian music and I encouraged her that I think it would be good to have a lead in voice section It was appropriate for the CD in Dec and it was entirely appropriate for her funeral service her celebration service ending with Marissa Jeremiah top of page All images text and design copyrighted by
