Irish These Hunters come from County Tyrone and County Down in Ireland Poland Hunter born in in Ireland arrived in Westmoreland Pa in the latter part of the eighteenth century His wife was Jane Simpson an English native who is reputed to have married Poland against her family s wishes It is said that this is the same Simpson family from which Ulysses S Grant is descended Poland and Jane were of true pioneer stock and with all the hopefulness of the Irish and the determination of the Scotch blood built a rude cabin cleared a field in the forest and thereby supplied the wants of their growing family Sixteen children were born to Poland and Jane twelve of which grew to maturity In Poland Hunter and his family moved to Tionesta and as a squatter appropriated the Island which bears his name located at the mouth of the Tionesta River Here he built his permanent home farmed the island and as a permanent settler obtained from the state a patent establishing ownership Poland and Jane lived on the island most of their lives although in later years Poland moved to the west side of the river At the base of the hill known as Hog Back near Hunter Run he built the first grist mill in Forest County When he died Poland Island was left to his son William for taking care of him during the last years of his life Ownership of the island remained in the Hunter family until when the heirs sold it and the land bordering it on the river shore for Later owners include R J Harmon Dan Mullet the Pioneer Material Company Jamieson Lumber and Supply Company Frank Ellis and F R Lanson Jack Sherman purchased it in February and established the Tionesta Sand Gravel Company In addition to farming Poland engaged in lumbering kindred pursuits in those days The History of Warren County related the following anecdote about Poland Hunter About the year while Henry Kinnear was acting in the capacity of constable in Venango County he had a warrant for the arrest of a notorious ruffian and desperado named Polen Hunter Against the threats of the criminal Kinnear attempted his forcible apprehension when he received from Hunter a wound in the hip from which he never recovered It is said that he succeeded in obtaining pecuniary redress for his injury The History of Forest County published in tell the following story Poland Hunter was a pretty rough specimen of Irish humanity He would sometimes take on more tanglefoot than he could walk straight under and staggering against a stump would say H l agin a stump and Poland agin that Poland Hunter shot a man by the name of Kinnear who had a warrant for his arrest Hunter peppered him with shot about the legs The wound was not mortal Hunter said that shooting him had made him a storekeeper and if he would let him shoot him again he would make a wholesale merchant out of him William Hunter was a chip of the old block Whenever he got too much crooked whiskey his temper got the best of him and everybody was in his way He and a man by the name of Groff always fought when they met Groff was small but full of grit In one of their fights Hunter bit Groff s finger The next day Groff was crossing the river to Hunter s grist mill He hallooed to Hunter when half way over the river I m bringing you another grist of finger nails to grind Though there are no historical records documenting the reason for the warrant on Poland Hunter it is likely the result of legal dispute with John Range Sr over the ownership of Hunter s Island Chief Cornplanter was called in to be a witness and to testify that he had passed through the back channel in a canoe thereby proving that Hunter s Island was indeed an island Hunter won the first case ever tried in Venango County Later on Poland s son William would marry Lt John Range s granddaughter Sarah Range Poland Hunter prospered and survived the hard life of a pioneer until dying at the age of eighty His wife Jane companion to all his privation and success had died two years earlier The party spirit ran high both then and now and Poland Hunter and his children were stalwart adherents of the Democratic party Burial was in the private Hunter cemetery on the west side at the
