busting six foot airs Twelve years later the magazines have regressed to putting fabricated idols on the cover doing nothing more than six inch chop hops all because of sponsor advertising dollars In the meantime Taylor Almost Famous Steele and his band of Hollywood wannabes are basking in their self appointed glory playing golf and dreaming up more staged video skits starring none other than themselves Somehow they believe we actually care Surfing isn t only about world tour contests of going on photo trips with a bunch of guys who aren t even your friends So while the so called surf industry is busy glorifying things only the pros do we re at least ATTEMPTING to get back to the real surf culture It s all about having a good time with your friends surfing at home from chop to closeouts going on road trips enjoying the freedom of youth and extending that freedom for as many years as possible while the masses around us chase a preprogrammed homogenized version of the
