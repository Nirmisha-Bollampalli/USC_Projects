an animal lover she saved the life of a dog that fell of the top of a cliff where she was climbing She has been working in the outdoors for years In Her Own Words The Job As a mountain guide my job is varied and full I am currently making my way through the ACMG mountain guide s exams which entails exams over about years and will cost a total of about to become a fully certified mountain guide This summer I will be both guiding and practicing my guiding skills in order to pass the guide s exam This means getting into the alpine as much as possible even if the weather is not as good as it could be For ex le yesterday my husband and I climbed the northeast Ridge of Mt Athabasca in the Canadian Rockies in a white out I led the day as if I was guiding while Rich acted as my client and examiner Rich is a fully certified UIAGM guide who examines for the ACMG I enjoyed the challenge of route finding with no visibility it s good to put yourself into situations like that so that you can be calm and practiced when such situations present themselves spontaneously I will also be guiding private clients this summer on multi pitch rock routes and mountaineering I am putting together a women s rock clinic through Ascending Women which entails gathering a great group of guides Some of the most accomplished and highly certified women guides in Canada have agreed to be a part of it Putting together clinics takes quite a bit of organization so that they run smoothly when the day comes Because I mostly work for myself I need to be highly motivated creative and organized in order to keep the business going but I also enjoy the freedom and variation I can bring to my life and work so it s worth it How She Got There I started climbing while I was at university at U C Berkeley I began to work at Cal Adventures U C Berkeley s outdoor adventure department a year after I started climbing This brought some institutional knowledge to my fledgling skills and really put me on the right track technically Since then I have worked for many outdoor companies guide services and climbing gyms I ve also created my own work within those frameworks travelling with a climbing technique clinic private climbing coaching writing operation manuals and training staff in newly opened climbing gyms etc I did not take intellectual steps so to speak to get where I am now I simply followed my love of the mountains and the outdoors The work followed The years I put into climbing simply because that was what I loved and wanted to do have paid off in the mountain knowledge and skills I have now How to Get Her Job To become a mountain guide one must first develop mountain sense which only comes from climbing and skiing in the mountains for many years in many different mountain ranges Only then can you approach the guide s exams I am enjoying the process of certification because it really makes me focus on my skills and knowledge I also love learning from mountain guides who have been guiding for or years you can t buy that kind of experience You have to love people to be a mountain guide or any kind of guide A guide must be able to interpret the medium they are intimate with in such a way that the clients feel like they are a part of the process not a lump on the end of the rope The mountain guide must be interested in people from all walks of life and in sharing full and often tiring days with all kinds of folk Guides have endless patience and love to see people discover their capabilities and to achieve things they thought they couldn t Guides also must explain to the clients the difference between safe conditions and the kind of conditions where you have to turn around Pros Being outside in all elements meeting people from all over the world Cons Long stints away from home can be stressful on relationships but can also be good if there is a balance some time away but lots of time together Salary Range Fully certified mountain guides in Canada make per day depending on what they are guiding and if they are guiding for themselves or contracting for a company although in the States one must be an employee of a company in order to guide under the current rules which makes the pay lower and the variety of what you are guiding diminish Her Dream Job Doing what I m doing Do you think there s any danger in your passion becoming your career As long as you keep variety in what you are guiding easy in Canada where the seasons affect what you are guiding from rock to alpine to ice to ski touring Also guiding independently possible in UIAGM countries such as Canada allows you to keep variety in what you are guiding I also like to keep other ways of earning money alongside what I do like writing studying biology teaching dance and practicing yoga Return
