avalanche if not for her rescue efforts but Abby Watkins says she s no hero The victims were in the worst possible situation at the worst time and we were in the best position to stage a rescue the year old assistant alpine guide said yesterday from her home here Anybody would have done the same thing Watkins and her husband Rich Marshall were skiing just above a group of Strathcona Tweedsmuir school students two teachers and an adult chaperone near Rogers Pass Saturday morning when the pair saw the avalanche begin Despite the couple s warning shouts all were hit by the fast moving wall of snow There was nothing they could do but brace themselves Watkins recalled It was very fast moving and when it hit the kids it carried them for or metres before it stopped As soon as the killer wave of snow came to rest Watkins and her husband skied about metres through the trees to reach the buried group All they could see was a single arm reaching through the snow They freed that person an adult chaperone with a satellite phone that was used to call park wardens for help Watkins who has training in such rescues but was never pressed to use her skills until Saturday morning and her husband turned their avalanche beacons from send to receive mode and started digging down to the rest of the group As one person was freed they too would start digging through the snow searching for their peers The teens although shaken by the twist of events that turned a pleasant field trip into an unthinkable nightmare almost immediately pitched in with little urging from Marshall and Watkins They wanted to do something Watkins said They tirelessly dug through the compacted snow while Watkins and her husband talked to the traumatized teens assuring them help was close at hand By the time the organized rescue party arrived all but two had been accounted for I was thinking a lot but I was mostly on autopilot Watkins said She credits her husband for keeping her focused Watkins said some of the survivors parents have thanked her but she has not dealt emotionally with the weekend s events We didn t sleep too well last night she said adding she may want to talk to someone later Parks Canada has counsellors at the ready Here s the pitch There s been widespread rejoicing that the federal government is considering a national don t call list that would offer relief from these pesky
