Michael Howard was born in Bulawayo Zimbabwe Africa He made his commitment to the Lord while in high school shortly before completing college he decided that his life was to be totally dedicated to the Lord and to the salvation of souls He was ordained under Assemblies of God in Zimbabwe pastored for years before moving to Chipinge on the eastern border with Mozambique It was there that God gave the vision for a missionary organization and Shekinah Ministries was birthed in the Spirit Michael under the guidance of the Holy Spirit began to operate in the areas where no others would go Michael takes his teams to bring life out of death situations and hope to the helpless The life and hope that only the Lord Jesus Christ can bring Michael is a fascinating captivating and inspiring speaker

saved and filled with Jesus Christ Our LORD is REAL to this man as Jesus is not this real to most Christians Here is a report a couple of my brief notes I can NOT do justice to this human dynamo on whom God s Hand rests MICHAEL HOWARD speaking and My comments on what Michael said Michael lives in the Sudan Southern Sudan is not all arab The muslims have asked China to come kill all non muslims in the south Sudan where Michael s bunch are China wants LAND so muslims will give China a year lease if they get rid of them Michael Howard started a Bible School there and these guys will DIE for Jesus Christ Allah is NOT OUR GOD Allah is a demon prince Perhaps the prince of Persia who withstood Daniel There are million muslims in America This means there are million TERRORISTS in our land If the leader of Islam declares a jihad holy war against the USA we will see suicide bombers in America as Israel is experiencing now Bill Clinton fought on the WRONG SIDE in Kosovo He bombed the christians and saved the muslims and brought terrorists into the USA Who is responsible CNN s Christiana Amanpour who is Iranian made the Kosovons so pathetic NOTE June the arab leaders in the MidEast

are afraid to DIE for Jesus Libya s QUADAFI actually said the ONLY thing he d fear is the Church of Jesus Christ IF it woke up but it s fast asleep Muslim soldiers captured Michael saying We KILL you We KILL you Michael said You CAN T kill me I belong to JESUS His LACK of fear of death frightened this troup of soldiers and he gave each of them a Bible and they knelt and received Christ right there PRAISE OUR GOD HALLELUJAH I want to tell you how inspiring Michael is as a speaker God protects them The muslims dropped two bombs right on top of their Bible school Michael watched them fall and said GOD DO SOMETHING God said hush I have this under control Watch I will show you a miracle God showed many miracles to Michael The bombs headed straight down for the school Suddenly one veered at a right angel to the RIGHT and the other to the LEFT both fell OUTSIDE the zone and exploded leaving the school untouched The Sudanese are afraid of Michael and his people They are afraid of our GOD Michael s people drove back n forth across mines none went off for months When a badguy drove across after months BOOM The word went out DONT TOUCH THESE GUYS GOD is with them Several such occurences That Sudan aspirin factory did indeed make chemical weapons Every day these chemical bombs are dropped on Sudan so that Michael and his students sleep with a wet towel I think he said wrapped around their faces The chemicals settle down around them at night The US is and must stand by Israel Islam may well include America in jihad I could go on and on with his stories CHRISTIANS in AMERICA JESUS CHRIST is the SAME YESTERDAY TODAY and FOREVER REMEMBER THIS Our HOPE is in the LORD Psalm tells us we are safe in Him As a believer you were created not only to influence people for Jesus as you shared the good news but also to pray expect the power of God to touch their lives when you prayed with them It was the signs and miracles that helped those whom were touched understand the awesomeness of God s love compassion toward them It was the heart of compassion not spiritual pride that led Paul to pray and obey and do what Jesus did preach expecting miracles signs and wonders to follow As Paul obeyed the Lord and expected the power of God to follow what He ministered his faith grew his compassion grew lives were saved delivered healed made whole BOOKS by MICHAEL HOWARD TALES
