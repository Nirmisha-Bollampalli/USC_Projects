office under Margaret Thatcher and John Major See Cambridge University Conservative Association Howard was called to Bar Inner Temple in and specialised in employment law and planning issues The late s saw his promotion within the Bow Group where he became Chairman in At the Conservative Party conference of he made a notable speech commending the government for attempting to curb trade union power Unlike his many Cambridge contemporaries Howard found it difficult to find and be selected for a winnable parliamentary seat and so continued his career at the Bar where he would become a Queen s Counsel in In June of that year Howard was selected for the constituency of Folkestone and Hythe in succession of the retiring the Sir Albert Costain He won his seat in the general election of without difficulty Howard had previously twice fought and lost the safe Labour seat of Liverpool Edge Hill in and these early races led to his support for Liverpool F C In the s Howard was a leading advocate of British membership of the Common Market EEC and served on the board of the cross party Britain in Europe group Howard was named as co respondent in the high profile divorce case of s model Sandra Paul She and Howard subsequently married in her fourth marriage their son Nicholas was born in and daughter Larissa in edit Career in Government Howard very quickly rose in the ranks of Government becoming Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry in with responsibility for regulating the financial dealings of the City of London This junior post became very important as he oversaw the Big Bang introduction of new technology in After the election he became Minister for Local Government On behalf of the Government he accepted the amendment which would become Section and defended its inclusion Howard then guided through the House of Commons the Local Government Finance Act This act brought in Margaret Thatcher s new system of local taxation officially known as the Community Charge but almost universally nicknamed the poll tax Howard personally supported the tax and won the respect of Mrs Thatcher for minimising the rebellion against it within the Conservative Party After a period as Minister for Water and Planning in during which he was responsible for implementing water privatization in England and Wales Howard was promoted to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Employment in January with the resignation of Norman Fowler Howard subsequently guided through legislation abolishing the closed shop and c aigned vigorously for Mrs Thatcher in the first ballot of the leadership contest in November He retained his cabinet post under John Major and c aigned against trade union power during the general election c aign His work in the c aign led to his appointment as Secretary of State for the Environment in the reshuffle after the election In this capacity he encouraged the United States to participate in the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro but he was soon after appointed Home Secretary in a reshuffle initiated by the sacking of Norman Lamont His tenure as Home Secretary was especially notable for his tough approach to crime which he summed up in the sound bite prison works Howard repeatedly clashed with judges and prison reformers as he sought to cl down on crime through a series of tough measures Under his tenure recorded crime fell for the first time in over years by a record a feat achieved neither before or since edit Infamous interview on Newsnight His reputation was dented on May when a critical inquiry into a series of prison escapes was published In advance of the publication Howard made statements to assign blame to the prison service A further controversy came when a television interviewer Jeremy Paxman relentlessly asked him the same question times in all and not the widely believed times during an edition of the Newsnight programme Asking whether Howard had intervened when Derek Lewis sacked a prison governor Paxman asked Did you threaten to overrule him Howard did not give a direct answer instead repeatedly saying that he did not overrule him and ignoring the threaten part of the question The BBC subsequently revealed that the repetition of the question was in fact a filler to extend the interview as the next segment of Newsnight was not ready for broadcast The interview remains one of the most infamous in broadcasting history In the longer term its precise impact on Howard s reputation remains disputed Some suggest that it highlighted his arrogant refusal to answer the question others suggest that it highlighted his resilience and refusal to be bullied even by one of Britain s toughest interviewers However in the same interview an incredulous Paxman also asked him do you seriously expect to be leader of your party In a November interview see below Paxman returned to his question from Mr Howard was surprised remarking Come on Jeremy are you really going back over that again As it happens I didn t Are you satisfied now This was confirmed in when under the Freedom of Information Act the Conservative Party obtained documents proving that Howard did not threaten to overrule Derek Lewis citation needed edit First attempt to become Conservative leader After the resignation of John Major Howard and William Hague announced they would be running on the same ticket with Howard as leader and Hague as Deputy Leader and Party Chairman However the day after they agreed this Hague decided to run on his own Howard also stood but his c aign was marred by attacks on his record as Home Secretary Howard came in last out of five candidates with the support of only twenty three MPs in the first round of polling for the leadership election He then withdrew from the race and endorsed the eventual winner William Hague Howard served as Shadow Foreign Secretary for the next two years but would retire from the Shadow Cabinet in though remaining an MP edit Something of the night about him claims Widdecombe Six days after the Derek Lewis incident on Newsnight Ann Widdecombe his former minister of state in the Home Office made a statement in the House of Commons about the dismissal of then director of the Prison Service Derek Lewis and famously remarked of Howard that there is something of the night about him a widely ed comment that fatally damaged his bid for the Conservative Party leadership The comment was taken as a reference to his dour demeanor which she implied was sinister and almost Dracula like and related to his Romanian ancestry Melanie Phillips felt there was a hint of anti semitism about the remark edit Conservative Leader After the General Election Howard was recalled to frontline politics when the Conservatives new leader Iain Duncan Smith appointed him Shadow Chancellor His performances in the post won him much praise indeed under his guidance the Conservatives decided to debate the economy on an Opposition Day for the first time in several years After Duncan Smith was removed from the leadership Howard was elected unopposed as leader of the party in November As leader he faced much less discontent within the party than any of his three predecessors and was seen as a steady hand He avoided repeating such managerial missteps as Duncan Smith s firing of David Davis as Conservative Party Chairman and imposed discipline quickly and firmly he removed the party whip from Ann Winterton following her telling of a racial joke His performances against Tony Blair at the despatch box were more effective than those of his predecessor as leader He was perhaps helped in all this by the Conservative Party s exhaustion after thirteen years of party turmoil following Margaret Thatcher s overthrow years which had left the party more willing to unite and rally round a leader In February Howard called on PM Tony Blair to resign over the Iraq war for failing to ask basic questions regarding WMD claims and misleading Parliament In July the Conservative leader stated that he would not have voted for the motion that authorised the Iraq war had he known the quality of intelligence information on which the WMD claims were based At the same time he said he still believed in the Iraq invasion was right because the prize of a stable Iraq was worth striving for His criticism of Blair did not earn Howard sympathies in Washington DC where President Bush refused to meet him Karl Rove is reported to have told Howard you can forget about meeting the president Don t bother coming Michael Howard was named Parliamentarian of the Year by The Spectator and Zurich UK This was in recognition of his performance at the despatch box in his previous role as Shadow Chancellor edit Crossing swords with Paxman again In November Newsnight again concentrated on Howard with coverage of a c aign trip to Cornwall and an interview with Jeremy Paxman The piece which purported to show that members of the public were unable to identify Howard and that those who recognized him did not support him was the subject of an official complaint from the Conservative Party The complaint claimed that the Newsnight team only spoke to people who held opinions against either Michael Howard or the Conservatives and that Paxman s style was bullying and unnecessarily aggressive edit Election In the May general election Michael Howard s party failed to unseat the Labour Government although the Conservatives did gain seats five from the Liberal Democrats and Labour s majority shrank from to The Conservative share of the national vote increased by from and from Commentators pointed to the state of Britain s constituency boundaries coupled with the first past the post British voting system which together heavily discriminate in favour of the ruling Labour Party It is estimated that changes proposed by the Boundary Commission for England would result in a gain of seats for the Conservatives with no change in the vote citation needed Despite the third consecutive loss Howard received much praise for the election results which bought forward strong elections policy on crime immigration and tax freedom day The day after the election Howard stated in a speech in the newly gained Conservative seat in Putney that he would not lead the party into the next General Election as he would be too old and that he would stand down sooner rather than later following a revision of the Conservative leadership electoral process Despite the election of a third consecutive Labour government Howard described the election as the beginning of a recovery for the Conservative party after Labour s landslide victories in and Howard s own constituency of Folkestone and Hythe had been heavily targeted by the Liberal Democrats as the most sought after prize of their failed decapitation strategy of seeking to gain seats from prominent Conservatives Yet Howard almost doubled his majority to whilst the Liberal Democrats saw their vote fall edit Criticism of c aign During the c aign Howard was criticised by some commentators for conducting a c aign which addressed the issues of immigration asylum seekers and travellers when he himself was the descendant of immigrants Others point out that the continued media coverage of such issues created most of the controversy and that Howard merely defended his views when questioned at unrelated policy launches Some evidence suggested that the public generally supported policies proposed by the Conservative Party when they were not told which party had proposed them indicating that the party still had an image problem Conservative John Major s lead in amongst the sought after ABC voters e g doctors lawyers students managers had all but disappeared by The c aign focus on immigration may have been influenced by Howard s election adviser Lynton Crosby who earlier had run similar tactics in Australian elections Whether the hiring of Crosby was a good idea or not in hindsight his organisation of the c aign was credited with making the Conservative election drive much more professional and organised than at the previous election During the c aign Howard continued to impose strong party discipline controversially forcing the deselection of Danny Kruger Sedgefield Adrian Hilton Slough and Howard Flight Arundel South Downs edit Cash for Peerages On October Michael Howard revealed that he had voluntarily been questioned as a potential witness concerning the Cash for Peerages investigation surrounding fundraising and the election c aign He is not suspected of any criminal activity edit Final months as party leader Despite announcing after the General Election that he would vacate the role of party leader Howard performed a substantial reshuffle of the party s front bench on the th May in which several rising star MPs were given their first shadow portfolios including George Osborne and David Cameron This move cleared the way for David Cameron who had worked for Howard as Policy Advisor when the latter was Home Secretary to run for the Conservative Party leadership The reforms to the party s election process took a number of months and Howard held power as leader for six months of the new parliament During that period he enjoyed a fairly pressure free time often making joking comparisons between himself and Tony Blair both of whom had declared they would not stand at the next General Election He also oversaw Blair s first parliamentary defeat when the Conservative Party the Liberal Democrats and sufficient Labour Party rebels voted against government proposals to extend to days the period that terror suspects could be held for without charge Howard stood down as leader in December of and was replaced by David Cameron Howard announced on th March that he will be standing down as MP for Folkestone and Hythe at the next election expected to be held in or edit See also Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet UK
